If so, and you didn't play over some arbitrary number of hours within the two week window, you can self-service a refund and then repurchase, and if you went over the arbitrary number of hours for the self-service refund, support might (and really should) give you a break with a price adjustment.

theAllseeingEYE,2021-05-25 00:00:46,0.9847,quote,Positive,"Both of these are excellent on X360 and essentially flawless. I'd also highly reccomend Guardian Heroes (and Bangai-O HD if you have an active X360) on X360/X1/XS.  I believe they were both ported directly by Treasure, they probably run at 720p but both support auto HDR, and still look quite nice on my LG CX. This is also the only place you can get Radiant Silvergun outside of a Saturn hard copy. Both very highly reccomended.   I don't know how Ikaruga compares to a PS4 version. If the PS4 version is 1080p that might be nice, and the PS4 version might have more trophy points (the X360 game is a live arcade version and only has 200 gamer score). Or you could go for the PC version if you want the best."

But anyway, Judgement is a whole different thing with a sequel coming soon-ish too, so that might be a better entry point for me for this universe."
Arctic Chris,2021-05-25 12:26:45,0.9402,quote,Positive,"The big thing with playing H1 and H2 in Hitman 3 is that you now have the Hitman 3 game engine running in those maps - a solid 60 fps everywhere. Smoother, better lighting - get to use any gadgets you have collected throughout your gameplay in all the maps. Hitman 3 is great, and being able to bring all the old maps to play seamlessly in the new engine is amazing. And Quick Resume works very well when work interrupts a mission."

Hardvlade,2021-05-25 15:16:09,0.9466,quote,Positive,"Yup! Super easy to do and quite convenient when games are free on other regions. Not as easy if you have to pay for the game (but it's possible!)  It's a good question actually! So the Xbox allows you to download the games depending on the region you're in. So if you claim this license, it will assign the game to your account. If you're using a UK account, it will download the version available in the UK. If you're in Japan, it downloads the Japanese version. The only time it will download a region specific version is IF the game isn't available in your region.  For example, I bought Psycho Pass from the Hong Kong store using my US account. Game was never released in the US on Xbox, so it just downloads the HK version of the game (which has English subtitles)."

Is this something MS know about and just don't care about? I'll take free games but it feels like an exploit"
Hardvlade,2021-05-25 17:16:49,0.7269,quote,Positive,"yes, you’ll get the version for the region you have your console set to  The way they have their accounts setup, they can be used worldwide. So if you moved to Japan, you could use the same account without starting over. I’ve claimed games from other regions since 2014 without any issues whatsoever. Heck I have gift card currency from other regions on my account. So I don’t think it’s something they’re against.  Only thing they make it difficult (and rightfully so) is buying games from other regions since that could be exploited, but the free ones are fair game since they just let you claim it. If MS was against that, they would’ve stopped it a while back."

I am a liberal mute button user so I have almost completely stopped using my Pulse headset. A cord is worth the convenience of getting to use that mute button. Also light on for mute makes sense. I don’t want that button glowing the whole time I am on voice chat.

darfox8,2021-05-24 11:23:55,0.5193,No quote,Positive,"I actually think it's great and it's great that it's on by default.   My main problem with the chat experience is that there doesn't seem to be a way to mute the speaker in the controller without plugging in a headset. I currently have a very weird setup where I listen to my PS5 audio through my computer headset and I frequently am chatting with friends on Discord. Recently I was playing Rust and all the in-game chat was coming through my controller so I'd have to take my headset off and try and hear what people were saying. I haven't found a way to just transmit in-game chat through the TV speakers(sending them through my PC audio mix), PS4 let you do that but PS5 seemingly doesn't."
Jafin,2021-05-24 11:47:00,0.3696,No quote,Positive,"Oh the DualSense mic is on by default? Yikes. I got Overwatch on Switch last year and completely forgot that that game puts you into group voice chat by default. Didn't realise until like my third game that my voice chat had been active the whole dame time because the headphones that I use have an in-line microphone. I didn't hear anybody else talk so hopefully I was the only one actually in there, but who knows. Every kind of voice chat should really be off by default, in my opinion."
MeBecomingI,2021-05-24 23:39:33,0.0,quote,Neutural,"What? What does that have to do with anything I said? The function is the mute button! You press the button to activate the mute function, so now it's ON and thus the light turns ON. Thus the light is OFF when the mute is OFF. Never did I say it should the opposite. Hence why it makes total sense.  Again, it follows standard electronics. You're turning the mute button ON, thus the light goes on."

XR.,2021-05-25 00:01:02,0.0772,quote,Positive,"You can make any arbitrary distinction as to what defines a ""function"", but the default state for any technical machinery is that it's off when no lights are showing, unless it's a red light. If the light is on, the machinery is on.  You can make any statement (affirmative or negative), apply a boolean value and call it a function, but it doesn't make it intuitive."
MeBecomingI,2021-05-25 16:40:24,-0.2273,quote,Negative,"There is no arbitrary distinction to anything. It is literally a mute button; that is it's intended purpose. Which means it has to be activated. Meaning it has to be turned ON which is the ""function"", so the light comes ON. That it as intuitive as it gets. This isn't hard to understand. You're making this way more complicated than it is. The mute is off, so the light is off. The mute is on, the light is on. It still follows the principal for any technical machinery as you stated. It's literally that simple."

The different character builds in this are going to be great and probably the main hook for playing. I've re-made my character a couple of times and prioritised aesthetics over skills.  Some of the story sequences seem a bit rough around the edges, but I can still appreciate what it was going for and I'm finding it a fun experience.  However, I find the dialogue quite annoying as each character speaks a line of gibberish, which you'll likely skip, and then the narrator speaks. If you press X too late you may end up skipping the bit that's actually understandable. It's happened to me on multiple occasions.  I definitely get the sense the scope of this game ballooned, but I'm cool with it and dig the vibe they've gone for. I hope it gets good reviews despite some of the downsides."

A lot of jank and copy-paste stuff. The campaign is very short (8-10 hours if you go critical path and use fast travel) but even then it's very repetitive. Played a bit of the side missions but it all seems very generic fetch quest-style and therefore quite forgettable.  "

unfashionable,2021-05-25 13:06:37,-0.7615,No quote,Negative,wow choice to use the narrator sucks IMO I know its a cost cutting measure but breath of the wild shows a good compromise where key lines/people have voice but its mostly just text. I was getting annoyed every time I hear the gibberish speak because its just wasting my tme - which when it happens with every conversation you have wastes a lot of collective time  I can see the complaints with the melee combat. shows how important it is to have enemies react eg stagger. they should at least add rumble for a successful melee attack  guns and magic feel good though.

Main thing the class gets is the dual handed sword but you can just craft one. melee combat is the least satisfying I think with this game. you can pick the class with dual wield and just wait to craft a dual handed sword (it was the first thing I crafted). felt like it had no impact and was slow to wield so I backed away from it

Not sure what I should be expecting but it defaulted to Max settings. I was getting framerates in the 40s and 50s and so I changed to High and the framerate stayed about the same.  But the weird thing is, sometimes it will go to places where the framerate is suddenly LOCKED at 72fps, which is half my monitor's refresh rate. So I'll be in these areas where it's locked at 72fps, and then I'll go to another area that doesn't look any different, really, and suddenly I'm back down in the 40s and 50s. What the heck? I don't have a framerate limit set in the menus. Why would some areas be locked to half the refresh rate?"
Pizzamigo,2021-05-25 15:54:13,0.8386,No quote,Positive,"Bummed out. Game looked cool, fun and different. Was really looking forward to this game for years and I do not like anything about it, having played it now. Nothing about the gameplay feels good and one of the most frustrating things early on is how much you get interrupted by character zoom-out narrator voice over, a 2 second boring cut scene, multiple back to back pop-up tutorials that freezes the gameplay, etc etc. The game early on takes away control from you so many times I wanted to pull my hair out. Play for 30 seconds, then boom zoom-out of your character for some 5 second scene. Play 30 more seconds and boom multiple page tutorial. Play 30 seconds, boom a dialogue tree cut scene having you to choose un-interesting replies/questions to keep the scene moving.   But the actual gameplay itself is so incredibly sub-par that I haven't found one thing I actually liked enough to keep playing. The mixed melee/ranged style combat is the most floaty thing ever with 0 impact or connection. Melee just doesn't feel good or fun. Looks like they were trying to go for Batman Arkham/Spiderman/Miles Morales type of melee with the constant dodging and parrying (with similar above enemy head icons tipping you off when to parry/dodge) but it feels so sloppy and weightless. It's the worst of that style combat that I've played so far.  I already completely lost interest in the way the story is presented through all these short flavor narrated scenes that frankly don't need to be narrated and just spammed at you non stop. I played about an hour, but 15 mins in I was completely over the singular voice/narrator talking in every single scene every 5 seconds.  The few ""puzzles"" I came across were the most uninteresting rotating puzzles, hopefully there's other styles puzzles later on but it's so uninteresting and simple that they don't add anything here if this is it for the puzzles.  The game is trying to incorporate too many systems but failing to make them good and it just brings the whole thing down imo.   Oh well it only cost me a month's sub of EA Play Pro (which I was using for Mass Effect Legendary anyways)."

Unfortunately that's pretty much what it is, just without all the bloat (i.e. content). Every ""base"" you visit to fight enemies and eventually claim is basically just a Ubisoft tower, copy-pasted all over the map. It'd be fine if there was more variety but that's pretty much all the open world has to offer, save for a handful of small, curated events. The more I read about what people were hoping for, the more I realized that the marketing direction of this game (with its self-proclaimed parallels to BotW) opened the door for people to transform what they were the game was going to be into an eventual of how it was going to play.   I'm always down for a beautiful open world with interesting mechanics however, so maybe with some post-launch support we'll get a game more in line with our expectations."

I can see people wanting to play pure melee being frustrated because melee could do with a lot of improvements (enemies react to being hit, rumble support etc) but I get a real fable feel to the combat and I like it  also I love how colorful the world is, its fun to me just looking around. it reminds me of enslaved in terms of vibrant colors.  in terms of production values its extremely low. so I get the low reviews but I am glad to see such an innovative game"

I'd like technology like youtube where you can speed up the video and it adjusts the audio so it sounds the right pitch (ie no chipmunk sound)
flyinj,2021-05-25 17:04:29,-0.5423,quote,Negative,The real kicker is I have completely disabled the narrator as it was too annoying having him read every dialog option as I could read it 10 times faster than he does and having him talking while I'm trying to read faster was annoying.  So the subtitle copy should be playing at the same time as the jibberish ideally. The fact that I even need to skip the jibberish just to read a silent subtitle is really annoying.

Skyrim I made the mistake of playing on ps3 and save become unplayable before finishing. Bought it on pc and I downloaded so many mods and just appreciate all of it the first 10 minutes and stop since I spent all my free time modding it."
Serpico99,2021-05-25 15:43:04,0.0,No quote,Neutral,Sekiro... I beat DS1/DS3/BB but I just don't have it in me with this game. I'm also being slow about completing Demon Souls. It's probably because I did blow back in the day during those games with my roommates taking turns...

Then I attempted it a year later but another game came out that I wanted to play to stopped playing it then.  Then tried playing it again 2 years later but my PC was really breaking and it was summer so my graphics settings where on like low and my FPS was like 35 due to heat and old hardware. Then bought a PS4 and made pretty decent progress through the game.   Now just waiting on the PS5 patch before I jump back in."

However, two times in a row I got quite far into the game and got distracted by something.

I think I've started TW3 two times and BOTW four times with the same result.  I'm going to attempt TW3 again though when the PS5 patch hits some day.  lol I'm almost at the end of the 2nd level (I think). It's not an easy game. But I enjoy it a lot regardless.

Woylie,2021-05-25 17:00:45,0.9825,No quote,Positive,"I’ve done this with a lot of games that people consider “classics” which were a little before my time. I just finished Symphony of the Night for the first time after starting it many times just to drop it early on. I loved SOTN, it’s super charming even if it has its flaws.  I’ll probably try to beat FF6 for the first time later this year, I’ve tried it a number of times and while I’m sure there’s a great game in there, the random encounters just make it feel like such a slog.  I’ve also never beaten either of the first two Zelda games on NES despite starting both of them probably a dozen times each. I know they’re classics for a reason, but I think they might just be a little too dated to be accessible for me.  I also really want to play FE: Genealogy of the Holy War, but despite starting it probably three or four times I’ve never gotten very far. I’m really hoping that Intelligent Systems does a remake of that game, because I think modern graphics/QOL features would really make it more playable for me, since I started FE on the GBA and even those are a little tough to go back to mechanically, after experiencing the increased freedom in classes and character builds (and also casual mode) from Awakening onward."

jmsebastian,2021-05-25 17:26:50,-0.7216,No quote,Negative,"Final Fantasy VI is the big one for me. It's not that I don't like the game, either. For whatever reason, I just have a block where I can't get all that far in it. Over the last year I've managed to finish a lot of games that I've abandoned for whatever reason, so I have hope that someday I'll get through it, but just haven't been able to yet. I think I've attempted a playthrough 3 our 4 times at this point.  Alundra is another one that I genuinely enjoy playing, but just have not been able to get all the way through. Started it a handful of times, and got the farthest I've ever gotten most recently, but gave up on it. I'm not the biggest fan of the types of puzzles it lays out, which may be the reason. It's probably a game that I'll finish before the end of this year though.  Eternal Ring was one that I had this problem with for a long time but finally managed to finish it up not too long ago. It's not very long so I'm not sure why I had so much difficulty with it. I guess having to craft rings for new magic types was enough of a departure from From Soft's other first-person RPGs that it put me off a bit.  Glad I'm not the only one who's struggled with some games that people consider all-time classics."

Off the top of my head, though, I can only think of one: - Witcher 3 (must have tried/restarted at least 4 times over the years - the lousy combat and huge-ness end up fatiguing me after 3-5 hours)  I tend to pick up a lot of games for replays (SNES, PS1, etc.) and then never finish them, but end up restarting them a couple times a year, every year. All the DKC games, Mega Man X games, Zelda LTTP, Chrono Trigger, bunch of other 16 bit RPGs, Marios, etc. At least I beat them once, I guess!"
