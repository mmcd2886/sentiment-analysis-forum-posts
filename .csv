If so, and you didn't play over some arbitrary number of hours within the two week window, you can self-service a refund and then repurchase, and if you went over the arbitrary number of hours for the self-service refund, support might (and really should) give you a break with a price adjustment.

theAllseeingEYE,2021-05-25 00:00:46,0.9847,quote,Positive,"Both of these are excellent on X360 and essentially flawless. I'd also highly reccomend Guardian Heroes (and Bangai-O HD if you have an active X360) on X360/X1/XS.  I believe they were both ported directly by Treasure, they probably run at 720p but both support auto HDR, and still look quite nice on my LG CX. This is also the only place you can get Radiant Silvergun outside of a Saturn hard copy. Both very highly reccomended.   I don't know how Ikaruga compares to a PS4 version. If the PS4 version is 1080p that might be nice, and the PS4 version might have more trophy points (the X360 game is a live arcade version and only has 200 gamer score). Or you could go for the PC version if you want the best."

But anyway, Judgement is a whole different thing with a sequel coming soon-ish too, so that might be a better entry point for me for this universe."
Arctic Chris,2021-05-25 12:26:45,0.9402,quote,Positive,"The big thing with playing H1 and H2 in Hitman 3 is that you now have the Hitman 3 game engine running in those maps - a solid 60 fps everywhere. Smoother, better lighting - get to use any gadgets you have collected throughout your gameplay in all the maps. Hitman 3 is great, and being able to bring all the old maps to play seamlessly in the new engine is amazing. And Quick Resume works very well when work interrupts a mission."

Hardvlade,2021-05-25 15:16:09,0.9466,quote,Positive,"Yup! Super easy to do and quite convenient when games are free on other regions. Not as easy if you have to pay for the game (but it's possible!)  It's a good question actually! So the Xbox allows you to download the games depending on the region you're in. So if you claim this license, it will assign the game to your account. If you're using a UK account, it will download the version available in the UK. If you're in Japan, it downloads the Japanese version. The only time it will download a region specific version is IF the game isn't available in your region.  For example, I bought Psycho Pass from the Hong Kong store using my US account. Game was never released in the US on Xbox, so it just downloads the HK version of the game (which has English subtitles)."

Is this something MS know about and just don't care about? I'll take free games but it feels like an exploit"
Hardvlade,2021-05-25 17:16:49,0.7269,quote,Positive,"yes, you’ll get the version for the region you have your console set to  The way they have their accounts setup, they can be used worldwide. So if you moved to Japan, you could use the same account without starting over. I’ve claimed games from other regions since 2014 without any issues whatsoever. Heck I have gift card currency from other regions on my account. So I don’t think it’s something they’re against.  Only thing they make it difficult (and rightfully so) is buying games from other regions since that could be exploited, but the free ones are fair game since they just let you claim it. If MS was against that, they would’ve stopped it a while back."

I am a liberal mute button user so I have almost completely stopped using my Pulse headset. A cord is worth the convenience of getting to use that mute button. Also light on for mute makes sense. I don’t want that button glowing the whole time I am on voice chat.

darfox8,2021-05-24 11:23:55,0.5193,No quote,Positive,"I actually think it's great and it's great that it's on by default.   My main problem with the chat experience is that there doesn't seem to be a way to mute the speaker in the controller without plugging in a headset. I currently have a very weird setup where I listen to my PS5 audio through my computer headset and I frequently am chatting with friends on Discord. Recently I was playing Rust and all the in-game chat was coming through my controller so I'd have to take my headset off and try and hear what people were saying. I haven't found a way to just transmit in-game chat through the TV speakers(sending them through my PC audio mix), PS4 let you do that but PS5 seemingly doesn't."
Jafin,2021-05-24 11:47:00,0.3696,No quote,Positive,"Oh the DualSense mic is on by default? Yikes. I got Overwatch on Switch last year and completely forgot that that game puts you into group voice chat by default. Didn't realise until like my third game that my voice chat had been active the whole dame time because the headphones that I use have an in-line microphone. I didn't hear anybody else talk so hopefully I was the only one actually in there, but who knows. Every kind of voice chat should really be off by default, in my opinion."
MeBecomingI,2021-05-24 23:39:33,0.0,quote,Neutural,"What? What does that have to do with anything I said? The function is the mute button! You press the button to activate the mute function, so now it's ON and thus the light turns ON. Thus the light is OFF when the mute is OFF. Never did I say it should the opposite. Hence why it makes total sense.  Again, it follows standard electronics. You're turning the mute button ON, thus the light goes on."

XR.,2021-05-25 00:01:02,0.0772,quote,Positive,"You can make any arbitrary distinction as to what defines a ""function"", but the default state for any technical machinery is that it's off when no lights are showing, unless it's a red light. If the light is on, the machinery is on.  You can make any statement (affirmative or negative), apply a boolean value and call it a function, but it doesn't make it intuitive."
MeBecomingI,2021-05-25 16:40:24,-0.2273,quote,Negative,"There is no arbitrary distinction to anything. It is literally a mute button; that is it's intended purpose. Which means it has to be activated. Meaning it has to be turned ON which is the ""function"", so the light comes ON. That it as intuitive as it gets. This isn't hard to understand. You're making this way more complicated than it is. The mute is off, so the light is off. The mute is on, the light is on. It still follows the principal for any technical machinery as you stated. It's literally that simple."

The different character builds in this are going to be great and probably the main hook for playing. I've re-made my character a couple of times and prioritised aesthetics over skills.  Some of the story sequences seem a bit rough around the edges, but I can still appreciate what it was going for and I'm finding it a fun experience.  However, I find the dialogue quite annoying as each character speaks a line of gibberish, which you'll likely skip, and then the narrator speaks. If you press X too late you may end up skipping the bit that's actually understandable. It's happened to me on multiple occasions.  I definitely get the sense the scope of this game ballooned, but I'm cool with it and dig the vibe they've gone for. I hope it gets good reviews despite some of the downsides."

A lot of jank and copy-paste stuff. The campaign is very short (8-10 hours if you go critical path and use fast travel) but even then it's very repetitive. Played a bit of the side missions but it all seems very generic fetch quest-style and therefore quite forgettable.  "

unfashionable,2021-05-25 13:06:37,-0.7615,No quote,Negative,wow choice to use the narrator sucks IMO I know its a cost cutting measure but breath of the wild shows a good compromise where key lines/people have voice but its mostly just text. I was getting annoyed every time I hear the gibberish speak because its just wasting my tme - which when it happens with every conversation you have wastes a lot of collective time  I can see the complaints with the melee combat. shows how important it is to have enemies react eg stagger. they should at least add rumble for a successful melee attack  guns and magic feel good though.

Main thing the class gets is the dual handed sword but you can just craft one. melee combat is the least satisfying I think with this game. you can pick the class with dual wield and just wait to craft a dual handed sword (it was the first thing I crafted). felt like it had no impact and was slow to wield so I backed away from it

Not sure what I should be expecting but it defaulted to Max settings. I was getting framerates in the 40s and 50s and so I changed to High and the framerate stayed about the same.  But the weird thing is, sometimes it will go to places where the framerate is suddenly LOCKED at 72fps, which is half my monitor's refresh rate. So I'll be in these areas where it's locked at 72fps, and then I'll go to another area that doesn't look any different, really, and suddenly I'm back down in the 40s and 50s. What the heck? I don't have a framerate limit set in the menus. Why would some areas be locked to half the refresh rate?"
Pizzamigo,2021-05-25 15:54:13,0.8386,No quote,Positive,"Bummed out. Game looked cool, fun and different. Was really looking forward to this game for years and I do not like anything about it, having played it now. Nothing about the gameplay feels good and one of the most frustrating things early on is how much you get interrupted by character zoom-out narrator voice over, a 2 second boring cut scene, multiple back to back pop-up tutorials that freezes the gameplay, etc etc. The game early on takes away control from you so many times I wanted to pull my hair out. Play for 30 seconds, then boom zoom-out of your character for some 5 second scene. Play 30 more seconds and boom multiple page tutorial. Play 30 seconds, boom a dialogue tree cut scene having you to choose un-interesting replies/questions to keep the scene moving.   But the actual gameplay itself is so incredibly sub-par that I haven't found one thing I actually liked enough to keep playing. The mixed melee/ranged style combat is the most floaty thing ever with 0 impact or connection. Melee just doesn't feel good or fun. Looks like they were trying to go for Batman Arkham/Spiderman/Miles Morales type of melee with the constant dodging and parrying (with similar above enemy head icons tipping you off when to parry/dodge) but it feels so sloppy and weightless. It's the worst of that style combat that I've played so far.  I already completely lost interest in the way the story is presented through all these short flavor narrated scenes that frankly don't need to be narrated and just spammed at you non stop. I played about an hour, but 15 mins in I was completely over the singular voice/narrator talking in every single scene every 5 seconds.  The few ""puzzles"" I came across were the most uninteresting rotating puzzles, hopefully there's other styles puzzles later on but it's so uninteresting and simple that they don't add anything here if this is it for the puzzles.  The game is trying to incorporate too many systems but failing to make them good and it just brings the whole thing down imo.   Oh well it only cost me a month's sub of EA Play Pro (which I was using for Mass Effect Legendary anyways)."

Unfortunately that's pretty much what it is, just without all the bloat (i.e. content). Every ""base"" you visit to fight enemies and eventually claim is basically just a Ubisoft tower, copy-pasted all over the map. It'd be fine if there was more variety but that's pretty much all the open world has to offer, save for a handful of small, curated events. The more I read about what people were hoping for, the more I realized that the marketing direction of this game (with its self-proclaimed parallels to BotW) opened the door for people to transform what they were the game was going to be into an eventual of how it was going to play.   I'm always down for a beautiful open world with interesting mechanics however, so maybe with some post-launch support we'll get a game more in line with our expectations."

I can see people wanting to play pure melee being frustrated because melee could do with a lot of improvements (enemies react to being hit, rumble support etc) but I get a real fable feel to the combat and I like it  also I love how colorful the world is, its fun to me just looking around. it reminds me of enslaved in terms of vibrant colors.  in terms of production values its extremely low. so I get the low reviews but I am glad to see such an innovative game"

I'd like technology like youtube where you can speed up the video and it adjusts the audio so it sounds the right pitch (ie no chipmunk sound)
flyinj,2021-05-25 17:04:29,-0.5423,quote,Negative,The real kicker is I have completely disabled the narrator as it was too annoying having him read every dialog option as I could read it 10 times faster than he does and having him talking while I'm trying to read faster was annoying.  So the subtitle copy should be playing at the same time as the jibberish ideally. The fact that I even need to skip the jibberish just to read a silent subtitle is really annoying.

Then I attempted it a year later but another game came out that I wanted to play to stopped playing it then.  Then tried playing it again 2 years later but my PC was really breaking and it was summer so my graphics settings where on like low and my FPS was like 35 due to heat and old hardware.

I just finished Symphony of the Night for the first time after starting it many times just to drop it early on. I loved SOTN, it’s super charming even if it has its flaws.  I’ll probably try to beat FF6 for the first time later this year, I’ve tried it a number of times and while I’m sure there’s a great game in there, the random encounters just make it feel like such a slog.  I’ve also never beaten either of the first two Zelda games on NES despite starting both of them probably a dozen times each. I know they’re classics for a reason, but I think they might just be a little too dated to be accessible for me.  I also really want to play FE: Genealogy of the Holy War, but despite starting it probably three or four times I’ve never gotten very far. I’m really hoping that Intelligent Systems does a remake of that game, because I think modern graphics/QOL features would really make it more playable for me, since I started FE on the GBA and even those are a little tough to go back to mechanically, after experiencing the increased freedom in classes and character builds (and also casual mode) from Awakening onward."

Over the last year I've managed to finish a lot of games that I've abandoned for whatever reason, so I have hope that someday I'll get through it, but just haven't been able to yet. I think I've attempted a playthrough 3 our 4 times at this point.  Alundra is another one that I genuinely enjoy playing, but just have not been able to get all the way through. Started it a handful of times, and got the farthest I've ever gotten most recently, but gave up on it. I'm not the biggest fan of the types of puzzles it lays out, which may be the reason. It's probably a game that I'll finish before the end of this year though.  Eternal Ring was one that I had this problem with for a long time but finally managed to finish it up not too long ago. It's not very long so I'm not sure why I had so much difficulty with it. I guess having to craft rings for new magic types was enough of a departure from From Soft's other first-person RPGs that it put me off a bit.

But I used it by just pumping Pylons into multiple enemies close to eachother. Or if im up against one enemy just pumping pylons into them . And then while you dodge or move to a better position you still just keep doing damage. It's pretty wild

Manmademan,2021-05-28 15:02:09,-0.9643,quote,Negative,"I think (and I've said) that Biome 1 is a massive brick wall and that's where most of the player deaths are. I wouldn't be surprised if the casual audience DID give up/take a break during Biome 1 or shortly after it in Biome 2, which is also not a picnic.  I don't have the ability to check it from here, but I took a quick look at how many people had defeated the final Boss last night and it was still under 20%. Given the steep dropoff in difficulty after Biome 3, I would estimate that most people who bought it didn't get past Act 1 and it's only about 25% that made it all the way through Act 2.  The game has a VERY strange difficulty curve where it is frustratingly, bizarrely hard for the first few hours then gets easy when you begin unlocking overpowered guns in Act 2.  edit: I'd actually compare this to the huge difficulty spike that exists in Bloodborne for new players when they run right into Father G as the first/second boss of the game and a shit ton of people just give up right there. Bloodborne only moved about 2 million copies through the end of it's launch year on a much larger userbase, so Returnal will be fine."

No saving is absurd and I think it needed mote time for balancing and tweaking progression. I'm planning on watching 4k/60 playthroughs of the last two levels, and I'm good.  Hoping their next games provide some better balancing and/or gameplay loops, because they did a lot of good stuff here. I just consider it pretty flawed. I don't want them to lean onto the ""gut gud"" or gatekeeping angle. There's room for a challenging game that respects the players' time and I don't think this does currently."

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:04:49,0.8025,quote,Positive,"The final boss broke my streak of beating every boss first attempt, and I was sad. It probably didn't help that it was super late that night, and I wasn't on my A game, but I think I died to the final boss twice, then beat it the third time.  Phrike really wasn't that hard to me, personally. I think he has some pretty easily avoidable attacks compared to some of the later bosses.  I actually felt like such a badass the last time because I did a run to unlock more unlockables, and went through each Biome, beating each boss in one go, and it was crazy to think how far I came from that first night on Atropos. The game is by no means a cakewalk. It's very hard. I had 39 total deaths by the time I beat the game, after about 50 hours of playtime, but you absolutely do get better at it the more you play.  I think the real trick of the game is finding your rhythm, which I think is a mix of a weapon that clicks with you, as well as a natural uncovering of the various enemies patterns, the range of their attacks, and really getting a handle on how Selene moves and what you can do.  As hard as the latter biomes are after the first, I felt like the back half of the game was way more forgiving than the first half, and the tools at your disposal by that point really do ease the difficulty.  Brilliant fucking game."

maabus1999,2021-05-28 15:11:51,-0.0772,quote,Negative,"Like I said, divide up 5.8 Million player hours over a month anyway you like, but it isn't good. Either sales were low (which going by some evidence off how it fell of the charts quickly is reasonable), players actually giving up immediately on this game and therefore may feel disappointed with their purchase, or a combination of both. I would guess giving up after an hour or two is extreme, but it is possible many gave up between 5 and 10 hours, which point to sales between 500k and 1 million after a month. So by just taking an average, it looks like out of 7.8 million PS5's, Returnal received about a 10% attachment rate which for a new console with limited new offerings is pretty low. May be a stellar game, but number's just don't look great.  Also might point to $70+ pricing for non-household IPs/Studios may be too steep for most customers, including for PS5 first adopters who usually spend more."

I hated that upgrade. I feel like the range and clip reduction was a bad trade-off.   My personal ""road block"" was thr second boss. Took me 3-4 attempts to beat him. Other than that I killed every other boss on my first try, some without full health and without any healing items. I've clocked 8 deaths in total to beat act 1.

Manmademan,2021-05-28 15:02:09,-0.9643,quote,Negative,"I think (and I've said) that Biome 1 is a massive brick wall and that's where most of the player deaths are. I wouldn't be surprised if the casual audience DID give up/take a break during Biome 1 or shortly after it in Biome 2, which is also not a picnic.  I don't have the ability to check it from here, but I took a quick look at how many people had defeated the final Boss last night and it was still under 20%. Given the steep dropoff in difficulty after Biome 3, I would estimate that most people who bought it didn't get past Act 1 and it's only about 25% that made it all the way through Act 2.  The game has a VERY strange difficulty curve where it is frustratingly, bizarrely hard for the first few hours then gets easy when you begin unlocking overpowered guns in Act 2.  edit: I'd actually compare this to the huge difficulty spike that exists in Bloodborne for new players when they run right into Father G as the first/second boss of the game and a shit ton of people just give up right there. Bloodborne only moved about 2 million copies through the end of it's launch year on a much larger userbase, so Returnal will be fine."

Hoping their next games provide some better balancing and/or gameplay loops, because they did a lot of good stuff here. I just consider it pretty flawed.

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:04:49,0.8025,quote,Positive,"The final boss broke my streak of beating every boss first attempt, and I was sad. It probably didn't help that it was super late that night, and I wasn't on my A game, but I think I died to the final boss twice, then beat it the third time.  Phrike really wasn't that hard to me, personally. I think he has some pretty easily avoidable attacks compared to some of the later bosses.  I actually felt like such a badass the last time because I did a run to unlock more unlockables, and went through each Biome, beating each boss in one go, and it was crazy to think how far I came from that first night on Atropos. The game is by no means a cakewalk. It's very hard. I had 39 total deaths by the time I beat the game, after about 50 hours of playtime, but you absolutely do get better at it the more you play.  I think the real trick of the game is finding your rhythm, which I think is a mix of a weapon that clicks with you, as well as a natural uncovering of the various enemies patterns, the range of their attacks, and really getting a handle on how Selene moves and what you can do.  As hard as the latter biomes are after the first, I felt like the back half of the game was way more forgiving than the first half, and the tools at your disposal by that point really do ease the difficulty.  Brilliant fucking game."

maabus1999,2021-05-28 15:11:51,-0.0772,quote,Negative,"Like I said, divide up 5.8 Million player hours over a month anyway you like, but it isn't good. Either sales were low (which going by some evidence off how it fell of the charts quickly is reasonable), players actually giving up immediately on this game and therefore may feel disappointed with their purchase, or a combination of both. I would guess giving up after an hour or two is extreme, but it is possible many gave up between 5 and 10 hours, which point to sales between 500k and 1 million after a month. So by just taking an average, it looks like out of 7.8 million PS5's, Returnal received about a 10% attachment rate which for a new console with limited new offerings is pretty low. May be a stellar game, but number's just don't look great.  Also might point to $70+ pricing for non-household IPs/Studios may be too steep for most customers, including for PS5 first adopters who usually spend more."

I hated that upgrade. I feel like the range and clip reduction was a bad trade-off.   My personal ""road block"" was thr second boss. Took me 3-4 attempts to beat him. Other than that I killed every other boss on my first try, some without full health and without any healing items. I've clocked 8 deaths in total to beat act 1.

I'll stick by word that the Electopylon Driver and Thermogenic Launcher are infinitely better weapons, especially the Launcher with Full Auto. It just completely decimates anything that's not a boss with that perk and decent bonus damage. Helped me beat the game after only 2 deaths.  I'm also surprised that the first boss is what's killed so many people, I felt like the 2nd boss was much harder and probably the hardest in the game."

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:41:32,-0.9977,quote,Negative,"The way I use the Electropylon is that I shoot one or two pylons into one enemy, then shoot additional pylons into any other enemies, or nearby environmental shit (walls, floors, trees, whatever), and watch them die, while focusing on evasion. Because it tethers to nearby pylons, it's very effective in taking out additional enemies that tend to flock together. So the ""trick"" is to make sure you're not focus firing pylons on a single enemy, and instead spreading your pylons across multiple targets. Usually, additional enemies will fly into the spider-web of damage and get taken out too. Another thing I'll do, especially in more confined areas, is create a ""pylon net"" by firing pylons so they form a barrier between me and the enemy, and when they fly in to hit me, they usually get decimated by it, but I can also still keep shooting pylons into them while they fly into my net. It seriously chunks away at their health so fast, they're usually dead in an instant.  In general, it's a good strategy to not focus fire on a single target, even if your weapon can shred them to bits. I say this because many enemies can be interrupted as they start to attack, and one of the things that leads to player death so quickly is being overwhelmed by multiple attacks coming at you at once. Since each enemy has a pretty clear tell when they're charging up to attack, I keep an eye out for those enemies, and prioritize them, so I interrupt their attack, then switch to another target that's preparing to attack, rinse and repeat, while again focusing on evasion. I've cleared rooms with some enemies never even having gotten a shot off, because I kept interrupting their attacks. Even a single bullet stops them from attacking.   This is not a pop and shoot game, and constantly being on the move is vital. I want to say that 90% of the time, I'm constantly moving around the field, even when I don't necessarily have to be, especially if it's a room where there are lots of enemies that spawn at once.   I initially didn't like the pylon, but my buddy encouraged me to give it another try, so I did, and it immediately became my go to weapon. I literally beat every boss with it, even the Biome 3 boss, and haven't looked back."

Manmademan,2021-05-28 15:02:09,-0.9643,quote,Negative,"I think (and I've said) that Biome 1 is a massive brick wall and that's where most of the player deaths are. I wouldn't be surprised if the casual audience DID give up/take a break during Biome 1 or shortly after it in Biome 2, which is also not a picnic.  I don't have the ability to check it from here, but I took a quick look at how many people had defeated the final Boss last night and it was still under 20%. Given the steep dropoff in difficulty after Biome 3, I would estimate that most people who bought it didn't get past Act 1 and it's only about 25% that made it all the way through Act 2.  The game has a VERY strange difficulty curve where it is frustratingly, bizarrely hard for the first few hours then gets easy when you begin unlocking overpowered guns in Act 2.  edit: I'd actually compare this to the huge difficulty spike that exists in Bloodborne for new players when they run right into Father G as the first/second boss of the game and a shit ton of people just give up right there. Bloodborne only moved about 2 million copies through the end of it's launch year on a much larger userbase, so Returnal will be fine."

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:04:49,0.8025,quote,Positive,"The final boss broke my streak of beating every boss first attempt, and I was sad. It probably didn't help that it was super late that night, and I wasn't on my A game, but I think I died to the final boss twice, then beat it the third time.  Phrike really wasn't that hard to me, personally. I think he has some pretty easily avoidable attacks compared to some of the later bosses.  I actually felt like such a badass the last time because I did a run to unlock more unlockables, and went through each Biome, beating each boss in one go, and it was crazy to think how far I came from that first night on Atropos. The game is by no means a cakewalk. It's very hard. I had 39 total deaths by the time I beat the game, after about 50 hours of playtime, but you absolutely do get better at it the more you play.  I think the real trick of the game is finding your rhythm, which I think is a mix of a weapon that clicks with you, as well as a natural uncovering of the various enemies patterns, the range of their attacks, and really getting a handle on how Selene moves and what you can do.  As hard as the latter biomes are after the first, I felt like the back half of the game was way more forgiving than the first half, and the tools at your disposal by that point really do ease the difficulty.  Brilliant fucking game."

maabus1999,2021-05-28 15:11:51,-0.0772,quote,Negative,"Like I said, divide up 5.8 Million player hours over a month anyway you like, but it isn't good. Either sales were low (which going by some evidence off how it fell of the charts quickly is reasonable), players actually giving up immediately on this game and therefore may feel disappointed with their purchase, or a combination of both. I would guess giving up after an hour or two is extreme, but it is possible many gave up between 5 and 10 hours, which point to sales between 500k and 1 million after a month. So by just taking an average, it looks like out of 7.8 million PS5's, Returnal received about a 10% attachment rate which for a new console with limited new offerings is pretty low. May be a stellar game, but number's just don't look great.  Also might point to $70+ pricing for non-household IPs/Studios may be too steep for most customers, including for PS5 first adopters who usually spend more."

I'll stick by word that the Electopylon Driver and Thermogenic Launcher are infinitely better weapons, especially the Launcher with Full Auto. It just completely decimates anything that's not a boss with that perk and decent bonus damage. Helped me beat the game after only 2 deaths.

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:41:32,-0.9977,quote,Negative,"The way I use the Electropylon is that I shoot one or two pylons into one enemy, then shoot additional pylons into any other enemies, or nearby environmental shit (walls, floors, trees, whatever), and watch them die, while focusing on evasion. Because it tethers to nearby pylons, it's very effective in taking out additional enemies that tend to flock together. So the ""trick"" is to make sure you're not focus firing pylons on a single enemy, and instead spreading your pylons across multiple targets. Usually, additional enemies will fly into the spider-web of damage and get taken out too. Another thing I'll do, especially in more confined areas, is create a ""pylon net"" by firing pylons so they form a barrier between me and the enemy, and when they fly in to hit me, they usually get decimated by it, but I can also still keep shooting pylons into them while they fly into my net. It seriously chunks away at their health so fast, they're usually dead in an instant.  In general, it's a good strategy to not focus fire on a single target, even if your weapon can shred them to bits. I say this because many enemies can be interrupted as they start to attack, and one of the things that leads to player death so quickly is being overwhelmed by multiple attacks coming at you at once. Since each enemy has a pretty clear tell when they're charging up to attack, I keep an eye out for those enemies, and prioritize them, so I interrupt their attack, then switch to another target that's preparing to attack, rinse and repeat, while again focusing on evasion. I've cleared rooms with some enemies never even having gotten a shot off, because I kept interrupting their attacks. Even a single bullet stops them from attacking.   This is not a pop and shoot game, and constantly being on the move is vital. I want to say that 90% of the time, I'm constantly moving around the field, even when I don't necessarily have to be, especially if it's a room where there are lots of enemies that spawn at once.   I initially didn't like the pylon, but my buddy encouraged me to give it another try, so I did, and it immediately became my go to weapon.

Manmademan,2021-05-28 15:02:09,-0.9643,quote,Negative,"I think (and I've said) that Biome 1 is a massive brick wall and that's where most of the player deaths are. I wouldn't be surprised if the casual audience DID give up/take a break during Biome 1 or shortly after it in Biome 2, which is also not a picnic.  I don't have the ability to check it from here, but I took a quick look at how many people had defeated the final Boss last night and it was still under 20%. Given the steep dropoff in difficulty after Biome 3, I would estimate that most people who bought it didn't get past Act 1 and it's only about 25% that made it all the way through Act 2.  The game has a VERY strange difficulty curve where it is frustratingly, bizarrely hard for the first few hours then gets easy when you begin unlocking overpowered guns in Act 2.  edit: I'd actually compare this to the huge difficulty spike that exists in Bloodborne for new players when they run right into Father G as the first/second boss of the game and a shit ton of people just give up right there. Bloodborne only moved about 2 million copies through the end of it's launch year on a much larger userbase, so Returnal will be fine."

Hoping their next games provide some better balancing and/or gameplay loops, because they did a lot of good stuff here. I just consider it pretty flawed. I don't want them to lean onto the ""gut gud"" or gatekeeping angle. There's room for a challenging game that respects the players' time and I don't think this does currently."

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:04:49,0.8025,quote,Positive,"The final boss broke my streak of beating every boss first attempt, and I was sad. It probably didn't help that it was super late that night, and I wasn't on my A game, but I think I died to the final boss twice, then beat it the third time.  Phrike really wasn't that hard to me, personally. I think he has some pretty easily avoidable attacks compared to some of the later bosses.  I actually felt like such a badass the last time I did a run to unlock more unlockables, and went through each Biome, beating each boss in one go, and it was crazy to think how far I came from that first night on Atropos. The game is by no means a cakewalk. It's very hard. I had 39 total deaths by the time I beat the game, after about 50 hours of playtime, but you absolutely do get better at it the more you play.  I think the real trick of the game is finding your rhythm, which I think is a mix of a weapon that clicks with you, as well as a natural uncovering of the various enemies patterns, the range of their attacks, and really getting a handle on how Selene moves and what you can do.  As hard as the latter biomes are after the first, I felt like the back half of the game was way more forgiving than the first half, and the tools at your disposal by that point really do ease the difficulty.  Brilliant fucking game."

maabus1999,2021-05-28 15:11:51,-0.0772,quote,Negative,"Like I said, divide up 5.8 Million player hours over a month anyway you like, but it isn't good. Either sales were low (which going by some evidence off how it fell of the charts quickly is reasonable), players actually giving up immediately on this game and therefore may feel disappointed with their purchase, or a combination of both. I would guess giving up after an hour or two is extreme, but it is possible many gave up between 5 and 10 hours, which point to sales between 500k and 1 million after a month. So by just taking an average, it looks like out of 7.8 million PS5's, Returnal received about a 10% attachment rate which for a new console with limited new offerings is pretty low. May be a stellar game, but number's just don't look great.  Also might point to $70+ pricing for non-household IPs/Studios may be too steep for most customers, including for PS5 first adopters who usually spend more."

KeRaSh,2021-05-28 15:32:36,-0.9096,quote,Negative,"It's an interesting stat for sure. It took me 18 hours to beat it once and 50 hours to platinum it.  I'm guessing a ton of players gave up way before that but no matter how you look at it i don't think it sold more than 500k copies. I do think it's enough to be profitable, though.  I hated that upgrade. I feel like the range and clip reduction was a bad trade-off.   My personal ""road block"" was thr second boss. Took me 3-4 attempts to beat him. Other than that I killed every other boss on my first try, some without full health and without any healing items. I've clocked 8 deaths in total to beat act 1. After my first playthrough I didn't die to any other boss on consecutive runs on my road to platinum."

maabus1999,2021-05-28 15:36:14,0.8201,quote,Positive,Low numbers is not equal to failure but go ahead. Again I'd imagine most people put in more than 10 hours in a month so I'm just stating that sales are probably under 500k which is just being realistic. The other numbers were just examples if those numbers did change. If Sony is happy with 500k sold that's fine.

I'll stick by word that the Electopylon Driver and Thermogenic Launcher are infinitely better weapons, especially the Launcher with Full Auto. It just completely decimates anything that's not a boss with that perk and decent bonus damage. Helped me beat the game after only 2 deaths.  I'm also surprised that the first boss is what's killed so many people, I felt like the 2nd boss was much harder and probably the hardest in the game."

Figboy,2021-05-28 15:41:32,-0.9977,quote,Negative,"The way I use the Electropylon is that I shoot one or two pylons into one enemy, then shoot additional pylons into any other enemies, or nearby environmental shit (walls, floors, trees, whatever), and watch them die, while focusing on evasion. Because it tethers to nearby pylons, it's very effective in taking out additional enemies that tend to flock together. So the ""trick"" is to make sure you're not focus firing pylons on a single enemy, and instead spreading your pylons across multiple targets. Usually, additional enemies will fly into the spider-web of damage and get taken out too. Another thing I'll do, especially in more confined areas, is create a ""pylon net"" by firing pylons so they form a barrier between me and the enemy, and when they fly in to hit me, they usually get decimated by it, but I can also still keep shooting pylons into them while they fly into my net. It seriously chunks away at their health so fast, they're usually dead in an instant.  In general, it's a good strategy to not focus fire on a single target, even if your weapon can shred them to bits. I say this because many enemies can be interrupted as they start to attack, and one of the things that leads to player death so quickly is being overwhelmed by multiple attacks coming at you at once. Since each enemy has a pretty clear tell when they're charging up to attack, I keep an eye out for those enemies, and prioritize them, so I interrupt their attack, then switch to another target that's preparing to attack, rinse and repeat, while again focusing on evasion. I've cleared rooms with some enemies never even having gotten a shot off, because I kept interrupting their attacks. Even a single bullet stops them from attacking.   This is not a pop and shoot game, and constantly being on the move is vital. I want to say that 90% of the time, I'm constantly moving around the field, even when I don't necessarily have to be, especially if it's a room where there are lots of enemies that spawn at once.   I initially didn't like the pylon, but my buddy encouraged me to give it another try, so I did, and it immediately became my go to weapon. I literally beat every boss with it, even the Biome 3 boss, and haven't looked back."

Manmademan,2021-05-28 15:44:35,-0.9083,quote,Negative,"Because it's not about ""Stats"" but skills on the weapon. If you didn't unlock Waves I or II, Portal I or II, or Turret I or II you'll miss why people are calling the hollowseeker the most overpowered weapon in the game.  The rotgland lobber is in the same boat- at base level it's not a good weapon, but start unlocking skills on it and suddenly it becomes a wrecking ball that melts anything remotely near where you shoot it.  Its when both Portal Turret and Portal Beam show up on the same hollowseeker that it turns from an ""overpowered gun"" to a ""win button""."

(According to that older Bloomberg report)  DLSS doesn't need a big increase in power. Look at DF's video about DLSS in Death Stranding for example. The game in 1080p upressed to 4K using DLSS used a lot less power than when the game was running in native 4K.  It does need a bump in specs though. But probably less than people are expecting.

A game like AoC is gonna perform much better without KT changing anything.

Pancakes R Us,2021-05-27 03:38:04,0.6943,quote,Positive,"I think Nintendo would be silly to just release a system with only a resolution bump like some people are assuming, over four years after the OG. Makes no sense whatsoever. Move the system forward. Don’t slow down. Don’t wait until sales fall off a cliff and people move onto other products.  We have moved beyond the cycle of a console lifetime having to be 5 years or more. Yes, there may be a lot of people on this forum and elsewhere from the old guard that want things to remain as they were, but those people, IMO, are the tortoises of yesteryear. Tech is moving forward and things have changed. Streaming is slowly going to be come more prominent over the next 5+ years. The gaming landscape has been changing and will continue to do so."

Zedark,2021-05-27 04:10:35,-0.8968,No quote,Negative,"So this is the sequence of events:  - Emily writes a tweet saying that Switch Pro announcement is imminent; - Bloomberg write an article saying Switch Pro will be announced before E3; - NATE quote-tweets it, saying 'if it is announced this week, it has to be today, since they're closed on Friday'; - Nate replies to his own tweet: ""Pure gut feeling: later today""; - Emily replies with a 'sssh' emoji; - Nate replies to that with a 'my lips are sealed' emoji; - Internet supernova unfolds; - Emily tweets 'we are goofing around, guys, don't read too much into this'.  It's possible that they have intel that suggests today being the day, but I don't think it's a necessary interpretation of this conversation tbh. Prepare for no announcement today if you suck at dealing with disappointment."

Lelouch0612,2021-05-27 04:14:54,0.0,quote,Neutral,I think all knwoledgeable people suddenly saying the reveal is imminent (which is unusual since it is way earlier than expected) means the news have probably spread to the Marketing teams.

Adulfzen,2021-05-27 04:38:57,0.6369,quote,Positive,I think most rumors point to exclusives being third party titles that couldn't run on the OG Switch. Think of stuff like Kingdom Hearts 3 not being ported after Square Enix did consider it and started some work who ended up unsatisfactory.

After what I felt was overpriced for the Switch $299 (I honestly felt 300 dollars was about $50 too expensive) it sold incredibly well despite me thinking it was a tad overpriced.   I even think it'll start at $399. At least Nintendo will try. I'd prefer $349 obviously.

cw_sasuke,2021-05-27 04:44:02,0.7272,quote,Positive,So the hardware isn't worth the price compared to the OG Switch ? Because from the leaks that's quite a massive jump on pretty much every level. Nintendo marketing it as a refresh or whatever doesn't make the jump any less impressive.  This releasing 4/5 years as a Switch 2 wouldn't have shocked too many a couple years ago. If that's what they were still doing in term hard generational resets.
kami_sama,2021-05-27 04:44:35,0.4996,quote,Positive,"The whole Pokemon tweets thing from yesterday is so strange. Why not reserve the date for a direct?

YolkFolk,2021-05-27 04:49:49,0.8467,quote,Positive,We could see 60fps.  I say this because Skyward Sword HD is 60fps. Would they want to go from 60fps with SS and then back down to 30fps with BotW2?  They never bothered with 60fps with WW HD or TP HD so it could be an indication that theyre comfortable they can keep the frame rate consistent across all the titles.  A performance mode accomplishing this would be fantastic.

Advance.Wars.Sgt.,2021-05-27 05:15:07,0.9696,No quote,Positive,"Maybe it's a matter of perspective, but $299 for the Switch was never overpriced territory for me considering I only had to spend $50 more than I did a launch 3DS to get a system offering an gargantuan increase in performance, screen real estate, and the ability to play Nintendo's home console games without actually having to buy their woefully supported home console hardware. And all for the sacrifice of 30 minutes-1 hour of maximum battery life. And also since I'm a #Neverdocker, I didn't have to pay the home console tax of additional cables, controllers, etc. just to get the most out of IMO the inferior setup OOB.  Switch and its successors will continue to remain the biggest ""steal"" purchases in traditional gaming until proven otherwise. So like duh I'm excited for the Switch mid-gen refresh. I'm just really hoping it gets the GBC treatment where we get so much dedicated software years from now people will debate it as something it's not - a successor system."

cw_sasuke,2021-05-27 05:36:16,0.875,quote,Positive,What better things are you talking about ? The goal would be to get whatever game on the latest version of the Switch. If Nintendo has a device powerful enough out there these devs are gonna support it accordingly instead of waiting until 2024 and the next upgrade.  I think these port jobs are gonna be the exceptions and it's gonna be immediately clear why these are Pro Only.
Nolbertos,2021-05-27 05:36:26,0.7169,quote,Positive,When the new3DS XL got announced. Nintendo never stopped production of the OG 3DS. Still kept going 2-3 years after its announcement. I don’t expect Nintendo to shut down the OG or Lite Switch userbase immediately. They’ll want users to slowly migrate to the newer model due to 3rd party games probably gonna promote some games to be exclusive and Nintendo will say we tried as best to make it OG compatible but you’ll have to upgrade eventually. By then the Switch Pro will be $299.99 SKU.

JershJopstin,2021-05-27 05:54:31,0.9196,quote,Positive,"People point to the PS4 Pro as the ""expected"" window, but I think a key fact people are missing here is that was announced alongside the Slim and - most importantly - a price cut for the base model. They didn't want to cut the PS4 price from $349 to $299 any earlier than they had to, but they also couldn't announce the PS4 Pro at $399 as long as they were still trying to sell the base model at $349. With the sales momentum of the current Switch model, it seems the expectation is for Nintendo to keep it at $299 and price the new one up high enough that the original model is still a decent value; perhaps $399 (mirroring the price of the PS4 Pro and base PS4 (Slim) post-Pro announcement). That is in itself unusual, and calls for unusual marketing. After all, if they expect the original model to be attractive enough to continue to sell at its current price right next to the revision on the shelf, why would simply announcing the revision cannibalize the base model sales? That's the argument I usually see for quick reveal to release windows for hardware, but it doesn't really apply here. Nintendo can instead give the announcement a little more room to breathe, giving 3rd parties more time to announce support at their leisure.  While Xbox was obviously in very different circumstances in 2017, I think it's worth noting that they also announced at E3 for a November release.  (People also look to previous Nintendo handheld revisions, but those aren't very comparable either; the GBC, GBA SP, DS lite, DSi, and new 3DS all replaced their base models unless I'm mistaken. The XL models in the DS and 3DS lines are the only exceptions here.)"

Aether,2021-05-27 05:55:16,0.9577,quote,Positive,"dont be petty.  ObviouslyGTA would be a bad example (because there exists a pre last gen version), it was more a joke on the fact that they started the next gen presentation iwth agta 5 port... it kinda became like skyrim in that regard.  I get that not everybody wants to buy a new console, or even has the money to do. And that geting exclusives stings. But lets say im a third party developer. Im currently developing a current gen game, and i see the pro could be strong enough to somehow get a port, but the og just isnt feasable. I could either not port the game at all (can we agree that this would be worse?), have it exclusive, or: a) develop a new game(would need a lot more resources, so its not like its an alternative to just porting, unrealistic) b) port with that team an older game ...which is kinda...boring. Here the rumored Handheld Steam console could ruin their plans, because it would be a portable pc where the ""ports"" already exist when there are pc versions.  You can be shure, that if its a not so power hungry game (rythm games, 2d platformer, ...) that there will be a version for the base switch.  I also dont expect nintendo to develop exclusives. So you will mostly get a hand full of third party ports that are not posible on the base (or maybe the base version will be a cloud solution)"

cw_sasuke,2021-05-27 05:58:51,0.7978,quote,Positive,GTA isn't a bad choice because that's all about GTA Online for Rockstar and probably the main reason the game hasn't been on Switch. In terms off storage and asset load times a Switch Pro with a faster internal storage of +128gb as well as much faster CPU to decompress the assets would make this porting job a lot easier.  Porting the PS360 story portion of GTAV never was the main issue but getting Online to perform well while not limiting it's potential on other plattfirms in terms of scope and features.

If we are talking giving most people the chance to play old games, then we really should rule for steam/valve, since most of those old games are already on pc, dont need strong hardware, and are cheap/on sale regularly.  So even with buying a new platform for that it couldbe cheaper than buying those ports on switch, since a lot of switch ports are at a premium compared to pc prices....  for my taste, the gaming industry is pumping to much money into rereleasing old games instead of establishing ways to play them and not have to invest development money every time again just to be able to resell them.

Thraktor,2021-05-27 07:21:35,0.996,No quote,Positive,"Well that's an interesting report to wake up to. Obviously the announcement being pre-E3, meaning within the next couple of weeks, is very surprising. Even with a release this year, I would have expected an announcement much closer to launch to avoid discouraging people from buying the original model.  What's interesting to me is that the timing is ""to allow publishers to showcase their full range of Switch games"", which to me would indicate we're going to see more third party titles exclusive to the new model than we thought. I've been saying for a while that, alongside running games in 4K using DLSS, the other design priority for this new model was probably addressing issues that have prevented more third party games appearing on the Switch, namely CPU performance. The 2021 third party lineup is still overwhelmingly cross-gen titles, so if they can release a device which is at least as capable as an Xbox One (which is very likely), then there's actually the potential to see a relatively large lineup of AAA games appear on Nintendo's hardware day one this year, and in relatively uncompromised fashion. Of course this is probably the only year this is true, as devs will move to PS5/XBSX as their baseline over the next year or so, but perhaps all the more reason to make the most of it and ensure they get a lot of exposure at E3 for AAA titles running on the new model.  In terms of games themselves, I'd say Ubisoft would probably have something, which would mean Far Cry 6 and/or Riders Republic, possibly with a late port of AC: Valhalla. EA is an interesting one, as their Switch support has been anaemic at the best of times, but they've finally brought Frostbite support to the console, so maybe that would open the door to them actually releasing a respectable set of games for the platform. Activision seems to be slowly morphing into a single giant CoD development studio, so maybe CoD? A while ago I would have said that Bethesda would be sure to support any new Switch model, but obviously that's not the case any more. Square Enix already support the base Switch with a lot of their Japanese-developed titles, but perhaps something new from their former Eidos arm?  In any case, it will be interesting to see what kind of third party support they've got lined up for the new model.  Also, on the name, my money is still on Switch+. It's simple, and easy for anyone to understand that it's an improved Switch model without having to explicitly call it Switch 2 (with all the expectations that go along with that)."

As you said I expect the cross gen games to arrive on it, but what about older last gen games? Will be interesting to watch. Yes and yes, depending on the game. It should iron out framerate dips and run closer to the upper limit of the dynamic resolution. Fingers crossed Nintendo goes beyond that, though.  I've read rumors about CPU and GPU, but what do we expect for RAM and storage specs? Any hints?"
Thraktor,2021-05-27 07:40:39,0.8957,quote,Positive,"I'd read the word ""publishers"" to mean they're talking about third parties, not Nintendo. Besides, they've already announced BOTW2 without saying it will run at 4K on the new Switch, so they can manage a few more months of showing their own games without talking about the new model. I also don't expect any Nintendo games to be exclusive to the Switch+ any time soon. Conversely, if third parties are working on games which only run on the new model, they obviously can't talk about them at all until it's announced, which would give Nintendo a reason to announce pre-E3.  Yeah, I'd expect a steady stream of PS4/XBO ports over the next few years, as many publishers seem to have found success porting older titles to the base Switch. Ubisoft have ported a few of the PS360-era Assassin's Creed games to Switch, for example, so I could see them continuing that with the PS4/XBO titles on the new model."

I have a ps5 as well. Nintendo games just FEEL so good and usually have solid stories. I dislike the Nintendo super fans that will literally buy anything just because, but I will hand it to them, I finish their stuff every time!"
RoadDogg,2021-05-27 07:55:50,0.899,No quote,Positive,I hope it’s a worthwhile upgrade but they really need to offer some kind of family program so I can manage 3 switches. We already own two and do the account share thing but a real way to own 3+ would make buying this one a no brainer. I get that would could go back to buying physical games but I feel like something like Apples Family Share makes way more sense on a portable device. They could even limit it so that only 1 account could access the game at a time.

Simba1,2021-05-27 08:57:16,0.9682,quote,Positive,"They are still relevant because positioning and marketing for hardware, and launching a revision and next gen platform are still quite different,  huge majority of users will not upgrade to revision because they know its same platform and that they still play 95%+ of all new games on their older hardware Xbox Series S game cant run on Xbox One X console, also its marketed like next gen platform Xbox Series S. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X were positioning like stronger versions, Xbox Series S/X and PS5 like new platforms,  by this revision will most likely be similar positioning like New 3DS, like new main Switch model not like new platform, and that means that we could easily in around 3 years have real next gen Switch platform (Switch 2)."

RelaxItsJustMe,2021-05-27 10:08:39,0.8995,quote,Positive,Exactly which is why I wanted them to just turn it into Switch 2. It would be a bigger deal and they can still do cross gen games for the first few years so they wouldn't leave their existing userbase behind.  There's already people claiming for there to be quite a few big pro exclusives IIRC like Nathan so at that point it really is just like the Xbox platforms where it just is mostly improved hardware. Hell even Xbox Series only has like 1 game that can't run on the older Xboxes in The Medium so.   In terms of upgrades it already looks vastly superior to just the New 3DS or even the Ps4 Pro if all the rumours about it so far are true.

Also if Nintendo allows Switch 3080 exclusive games, then those wouldn't be shown at E3 without a announcement beforehand. Of course Nintendo could make sure to be first at E3, but they never were before and it doesn't seem likely. So announcing the console before makes sense. Gives EA, Ubisoft and many more the platform to announce games for the platform."

I do suspect that the majority of games (read indie games) will still focus on the OG Switch, and that the big N titles will be OG games that will be enhanced on the new unit - even if it's just frame rate and resolution. I expect that we'll see some big third party titles (e.g. DQXII, Mass Effect Legendary, Borderlands 3, GTA V, etc) will be exclusive to the new unit over the OG Switch.

I’m wondering whether that power will even be relevant to devs when thinking about best possible sales metrics. Switch metrics has been insane ever since it’s inception and to lose that in the pursuit of power is a harder pill to swallow than most people are giving credit for. It’s why I think it’s really only Nintendo games that will benefit from the added power while it’s a questionable value proposition for indies and third parties.  Again I use the 3DS as an example because you had N3DS XL replacing the original, and yet, not many games took advantage of its power. Most of the games were still developed to ensure that people with 3DS didn’t miss out. The issue I have with Super Switch is that it tends to be only the enthusiasts that will go out of their way for a premium experience. Generally, the general audience doesn’t care that much if they’ve already had a Switch."

That lets them allow 3rd parties to announce all their stuff (including stuff that would be Switch 2/Pro/whatever exclusive) and get the hardware fervor out of the way before moving on to other things."

Both unity and UE4 will be getting dlss plug-ins so getting a game that can run on Pro but not the Switch is alot more likely because may just target Switch Pro and not worry about Switch when they are developing for multiple platforms."

Thraktor,2021-05-27 11:55:35,0.7184,quote,Positive,"An 8 core A78 CPU at 1.2GHz would be a  performance improvement over the 4x A57 at 1GHz in the base Switch. Close to a generational performance jump, compared to the very modest CPU clock bump in the PS4 Pro. You're also talking about doubling the RAM to 8GB, vs the PS4 Pro having the same amount of RAM as the base model, and a 800Gflops docked GPU is double the raw performance on a much newer architecture, which would put it in line with the jump from PS4 to Pro. I'd also say an 800Gflops docked GPU is on the lower end of expectations, I'd say best case is around twice that (although I'd expect something closer to 1.1-1.2Tflops, personally). Of course all of this is without factoring in DLSS. Even on the low-end of possibilities, I'd expect something with a significantly more noticeable performance gap than the PS4 to PS4 Pro."

Now if they add things like VR and cameras, then you can add the playful names. Also, I think they would want to avoid the marketing confusion they had with the Wii U."

But even if it was, more games actually hitting 1080p--and even with decent anti-aliasing--will be a big improvement to me.

How many third parties are going to bother if they think even most new Switch purchases will continue to not be potential customers for those newer games? So Switch sells 30 million in a year... but why does that matter to Activision or Take Two if only 8 million of them can buy ""Pro exclusives"". If it becomes the new norm, though, everyone except new Lite purchasers are in."

MegaManTrigger,2021-05-27 12:30:57,0.9379,quote,Positive,"Not sure the environment matters that much. The presumed super switch is going to have certain power advantages over the base switch, and that will result in vastly different experiences that you can’t really program your way out, for the base model. Sure you have the DLSS plug-ins, but we also don’t know what the CPU or RAM improvements are. If they decide to add more improvements there, then you’re asking devs to essentially build four different profiles of the same game (super switch dock, super switch handheld mode, and OG variants).  At the end of the day, the question that iterative consoles always face is: Is it enticing for the end user to upgrade? And so far, it’s always been a tough sell for the general public and devs."
Gobias-Ind,2021-05-27 12:32:13,0.9366,quote,Positive,"But Switch ports are often ""poorly optimized"" as it is. My concern with this discussion is that people are going to lose that perspective when the new hardware comes out.  The Doom ports get praise now because most people understand the Switch is what the Switch is. There's no reason to compare it harshly against the PS4/Xbone versions. But in the Super Switch era, we're going to get ports that run 30FPS at sub-hd resolutions on OG Switch, while they run at 60FPS HD+ on the Super and look as good to the naked eye as a PS4 version. Pre-Super that OG version would be entirely non-controversial. Post-Super there's going to be some degree of outrage at OG Switchers being treated like ""second class citizens"" or something."

Finally having a healthy 3rd Party market, Nintendo would be wise to enable easier late ports from PS4/One - almost all open world games didn't make the cut. It's an entire genre being absent right now because it's technically not feasible. And never had been portable.  Give it 3-4 years, if the jump in tech is high enough and the current model is phased out, there's gonna be 50m in New Switches and an audience that will buy exclusive games.

Going in increments through the generations and try to copy the smartphone business in releasing new hardware every other year (maybe every 3 or 4 years) where their software works on every system would be the way to go. It's easier to maintain their audience, they can react ""fast"" to new developments on the market and can make use of cheaper and/or better hardware.   But this is Nintendo after all.

Would someone who got their first Switch at 13 buy a Switch Pro at the age of 18 instead of a PS5 now that his favorite 3rd party games might also appear there and it's cheaper but still 4K?   In 2017 the Switch was mainly marketed to the core gamer who then reacted extremely positive and word of mouth followed so that all kinds of audiences jumped on board buying basically everything from Doom to Cities Skylines. It would be smart to repeat that approach and Nintendo are setting themselves up to do exactly that with a Pro/BotW2 combo - 3rd parties followed suit as soon as they realized that people actually buy software for the Switch outside of Nintendo games. They will be here day 1 if they see the possibility for a sale.

I take the position that under the surface/hood, , backwards compatibility imparts 'iterative' status, as opposed to the hard reset to 0 software aspect of 'classical' console generations.  ...I'll admit that there's something funky about this logic when looking at Nintendo's dedicated handhelds."
Gobias-Ind,2021-05-27 14:16:18,0.9553,quote,Positive,"Maybe. Within a year or two, anybody who goes into a store to buy a new Nintendo Switch will only have the Switch with this new chip in it as the option (it remains to be seen when they'll upgrade the Lite but I fully believe that's coming by end of 2023 at the latest). This is the Switch going forward. Sure, it's not going to surpass, or even meet, that 80 million number in the near future, but it's going to be a lucrative platform to release video games on.  If a port of a current-gen game is feasible on this hardware, why not release it? Did it make sense for devs to release software on the Switch when it had a <10 mil install base in 2017?  The chances are significant imo that when Nintendo starts announcing games that don't run on OG Switch (2024-25 or later) they will run on this. The traditional ""next-gen"" paradigm is fading away a bit but, once we get some distance from this release, I think people will come to understand that this is the first device in the second generation of the Switch family. Some will try very hard to not understand that, continuing to insist that Nintendo needs to arbitrarily drop their current platform and that Nvidia is going to magically conjure up yet another new mobile SoC in a couple years that provides a much larger technical leap than what we're going to see from the Super Switch but I don't think that's happening.  The Switch coming this fall is replacing a nearly 7 year old chip. It's going to be a significant tech leap. Waaaayyyyyy more significant than the jump from WiiU to Switch and, relative to where it's coming from, probably quite a bit more dramatic than the PS4>Pro or Xbone>OneX jumps. Even though we won't see the first party exclusive ""next-gen"" software we expect from a new generation, this upgrade will have the power gainz one would expect from a generational leap."
Dylan McGrann,2021-05-27 14:17:09,0.5423,quote,Positive,"I agree.  I do however think it’s somewhat possible Nintendo releases an exclusive of their own for a Switch ‘Pro’.  The vast bulk of their lineup, especially the Zeldas and Marios, will of course release for the base  ‘Pro’ models, but I don’t think it’s out of the question they release a more niche title for the ‘Pro’. Something along the lines of a  or a remaster.  But if there’s multiple third-party titles exclusive to the ‘Pro’, I think the odds of a first-party title exclusive to ’Pro’ diminishes."
xyla,2021-05-27 14:17:24,0.9839,quote,Positive,"I dunno, they matter less and less as the generation continues but they are the industry enthusiasts (maybe that's the better word for that group of people, ""core gamer"" still carries a slightly bitter taste) that are there from the very start. Good word of mouth from the get go is very important - something like the Xbox One reveal debacle took years to correct. MS going for Kinect at launch and having that weird multimedia approach took ages to get out of people systems. And it was mostly those enthusiasts that spread their distaste online and against whom the marketing people had to work against.  MS dedicated a big part of their strategy for upgrading old games. I would say this is mainly directed at enthusiast gamers who are on the platform early. They could keep selling the original version without any improvements but they invest time and money into making old games stand out. Because it generates goodwill from enthusiast gamers. I would argue that the PS5+ library and the 60fps updates are mainly for that too.  My example on the Nintendo side would be 1-2 Switch - didn't set the world on fire despite being an impressive piece of software when it comes to haptic feedback and beind sold at a low price point. It's mostly forgotten though. It was marketed to people simply not on the platform yet.  PS5 on the other hand was very successful with something like Astrobot painting the launch in a coat of PlayStation nostalgia and making their haptic controller stand out positively. Blue ocean people wouldn't care for that part of the game at all."

Dylan McGrann,2021-05-27 14:31:59,0.1655,quote,Positive,"This is why I’m curious what Nintendo ends up calling it. I think the naming could tell us something of how they see the future of the platform, and whether this new model will be positioned more as an iteration or a pivot.  On the iterative end there’s ‘Switch Plus’ or ‘Switch XL’, and at the transition end ‘Switch 2’. I think ‘Switch Pro’ is unlikely, but ‘Super Switch’ would suggest something closer to ‘Switch 2’."

So, very likely that it games that cannot run absolutely in any playable condition on the base switch, most will aim to target all platforms in the switch platform because it is a large install base. There will still be downgraded ports to the base switch especially since Panic Button, Saber Interactive, etc., were hired for those instances."

Joking aside, there was a very heated argument a few months back when I suggested the '2 month' announce to launch rule is not a magic rule. If this product is indeed getting announced in early June or at E3 for a Sept-Oct launch, it would certainly not fall within that rule.  The same discussion also had commentators artribrarily excluding the possibility of an announcement around or at E3, because it didn't fit recent patterns with the new 3DS and Switch Lite.  I keep saying this, sometimes thing align and it looks like a pattern, but business requirements and other considerations are probably more important and outside of the order of things happening (announce the thing > launch the product) nothing is going to fit neatly into patterns. Our sample size is so small spread over decades, Nintendo's not going to care what they did 12 years ago with the DSi when planning the release of the Super Switch."

HOUSEJoseph,2021-05-27 22:47:14,0.09,No quote,Positive,These thoughts about the Switch revision having exclusive games makes me wonder if this is a new generation in disguise. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X were half steps but no exclusive games. It’ll be interesting to see the power differences of this revision. DLSS may exaggerate the gap between Switch and Switch “Pro”.

I just don't think they'll transition as fast as the 3DS to N3DS (or DS to DS Lite), where not just production but basically all marketing and branding switched immediately to the new hardware. It's a lot easier to do that, without anyone feeling like the rug is pulled out from under them, when the chips are the same, resolution is the same, SDK doesn't expose any major new features, etc. And it's arguably beneficial to the initial sales of the revision to have a number of months where new titles are marketed on both, to let people make comparison videos and the like."

I thought it was as clear as the Advance proponents referencing GBA, and why it's almost always written as ""Super Nintendo Switch"" rather than just ""Super Switch"". That image doesn't give the full picture, and ignores the lack of worldwide launches. Like, DSi launched very quickly after announcement in Japan, but it was a half year until it reached the other major regions, so a hell of a lot of potential time for lost sales--including a holiday season!  But mostly I think it comes down to the third party thing. In exchange for announcing slightly early, they don't have to make third parties with relevant content hide it during some of their biggest presentations of the year."

If it is not a 100% straight and firm surface, it does not work. Its hard to pull out (the rubber wore off from unclipping it), there where no fancy accented options (missed oportunity, sell those for 5-10€ per piece in designs and colors), ...  the improvements look good. Add a better housing (the original had a shine really fast, and was actually prone to morphing or cracking, more so then previous nintendo products)  for the joycons: honestly, make a revision thats backwards compatible, based on the new design.  no new features (ok, analog triggers and better feedback than hd rumble would be nice), but overall just revise them somewhat, but have the old switch be compatible with them."

It's a no brainer to offer an official, fully featured, left joy-con with a traditional d-pad. They have the ability to considering the Lite. And finding a new joystick, that is less prone to drift, should also not be an issue. Design it yourself or find one with better materials. You got the money to R&D that. But I like that the form factor of them overall and understand the point of them as the default control system, just do more than special colors for individual sale."

DJ Lushious,2018-02-19 13:41:42,0.6808,quote,Positive,"Once you have 30+ slimes in your base (there are no levels, at least not that I am aware of, it's a semi-open world that expands with time and progress) the physics calculations run the CPU into the ground. That's when the fun begins, because the game slows down to where you move one meter every second. Frame rate stays stable, but that's only half the story here. The game becomes unplayable whenever you are in your base (where you have to do things like defend it or catch select slimes or feed them)."

Betelgeuse,2018-02-19 15:39:26,0.5846,quote,Positive,"Aggressive is the only option, in my opinion (I'm close to the end). 'On' drops frames frequently enough to the point of being constantly distracting. 'Off"" isn't even playable - we're talking sub 30 fps in areas. Aggressive is great; it's not perfect but close enough to a locked experience that provides the smoothness where Wolf 2's frenetic action really shines. IQ will take a hit, but framerate consistency is far more important for this game, and even on aggressive it still looks nice given the high-quality lighting and particle effects."

I picked up the Xbox One version of Doom over the holidays. I got the Platinum on the PS4 and would happily play through it again with X enhancements. It was such an exciting, visceral, adrenaline-pumping experience and what I've wanted in a Doom game ever since Doom 2; I can only imagine how gorgeous the game would be in 4K. Or, better yet, with HDR, too. All the dark parts of the game would be perfect for HDR.  I like the idea, but I think it's too subjective. What about WCFTech's opinion? Or NX Gamer's? It might be best to approach the data with a ""just the facts ma'am"" approach. I toyed around with the idea of replacing ""2160p"" with the 4K logo, similar to how I list  titles, but, in the end, I thought the true 2160 number was the best way to convey the information."

CrashedAlex,2018-02-22 05:38:25,0.9974,No quote,Positive,"Here is some detail about the work we did on our indie title DANGER ZONE for Xbox One X.   We're a tiny team of seven but we're big Xbox fans so when we finally got the performance we needed to get the game running on Xbox (thanks Epic!) we wanted to be there at launch with some Xbox One X improvements.  The game will run in native 4K on Xbox One X.  In the Settings you get to pick between two options - ""Best Quality"" or""Best Performance""  Best Quality - this setting runs the game at 30hz in native 4k (if you're the lucky owner of a 4K display!) - ALSO if you're still rocking a 1080p display - choosing this setting will supersample the 4K render to your output resolution and give you the sharpest possible image. You also get dynamic shadows enabled.  Best Performance - this runs the game at a super smooth and silky 60hz at 1080p resolution. You don't get dynamic shadows enabled.  The game doesn't support HDR yet. The reason for that is because the engine that we use, Unreal Engine, didn't support HDR at the time we were finishing the game and submitting it.   We use SSAO and SSR as well as Temporal AA, the game renders the HUD in 4K regardless of what setting you choose.  And if you boot the game during the Christmas holidays, we put up a tree, put some presents under it for you and play a spectacular 'muzak' version of ""Jingle Bells"" for your aural listening pleasures.  (That comes from being inspired by N64 ""Super Mario Kart"" all those years ago where the title screen went Gold when you got all Golds - so we wanted to change the game depending on the holiday season!)  Hope that fills in the gaps on the front page. Hopefully, if small indies like us can make the effort on Xbox One X then surely all the big teams can do the same!"

Scently,2018-02-22 06:05:04,0.886,quote,Positive,Read your X1X entry on your website. One of the best use of the 1X so far; going from 900p to native 4k with dynamic shadows enabled. Very few games have been able to achieve that kind of scaling. The 60fps option at 1080p is icing on top. Nice work.

It was probably the textbook example of 'messing up' at the time. It came together very very late. And it probably looked a bit too brown and yellow in the end.

So thank you for your support!  Stay tuned to our website where we'll list any time our titles our on sale. We mail our mailing list every time there is a promotion. But I think there's a good little game there for twelve quid. And the game has got updated twice with more levels since it released. I've paid far more myself for games that received nothing.  As the developer, we make seven pounds out of that twelve pound price point after the store owner takes their cut. Not a lot of people realise that, and we hope that our pricing is affordable to most.  Each level took close to a full day for me to make. That includes throwing away ideas that didn't work and also iteration time. Each one averaged about seventeen hours. There's a level called ""Semi-Conscious"" in there - and I can remember playing it 579 times as I added each part to it during the day. I don't think I can play that level ever again. (Maybe there's an Xbox One X in ""The Good Place?"" ....Janet...?)  Still, it's better than digging a ditch as they say."

Maybe even Xbox Burnout 3 as well. But I deleted all of my emails from that period of my career now so have no way of checking.

Burnout 2 on PS2 was the first game that really made me take notice.

So you (well, we) basically get 4 settings: 4K - Quality 4K - Performance 1080p - Quality 1080p - Performance  In my experience, it boils down to this (I'm quite sensitive to framerate): 4K - Quality : Framerate will have a tendency to hover around 30fps. In some situations it can drop to the 20s but those are thankfully pretty rare. 4K - Performance : Highly fluctuating framerate. Can reach 60fps in the simplest scenarios. Will rarely drop under 30fps. 1080p - Quality : Relatively solid 60fps. May drop in the 40s in some of the most complex planetary scenarios. 1080p - Performance : Extremely solid 60fps.

On average, Pro has received at least 3 enhanced games a week since last February. (I say ""at least"" because that only counts ones I've verified and put on my list. Dozens more are likely to have support, but I just haven't been able to confirm.) If anything, I'd expect One X to get more support now that there's two enhanced platforms available to devs.  The new machine has been a definite success for Microsoft all round."

There will certainly be some more--Microsoft have said so--but at least right now it seems the pace will be lower. Of course, all that's subject to change.  Yes, the difference is significant for folks with no interest in VR...though it shrinks again if they have no interest in old games, and basically disappears if they like VR but not old games. But that requires the purchase of additional hardware, etc. etc.   I'm not sure how important it is that we get this comparison very precisely correct. We're talking launch-aligned here, so it's not as if these are the actual choices presented to customers now. My point was a more general one: that One X is not following a trajectory of lower support than Pro--in fact, it's higher--despite the Xbox One platform as a whole getting less support than PS4 overall. This is a good sign for One X.  BC and VR are both secondary in the sense that they're considerably less of a draw than the main games on the platform. Of course VR has a hardware requirement barrier to entry, so it's more marginal than BC. Neither are totally negligible factors in analysis, though, so all those games need to be counted.

Liabe Brave,2018-02-23 15:54:03,0.9883,quote,Positive,"Not sure how these numbers are supposed to contradict what I said. PSVR got 15-20 enhanced games in the first three months, and over 50 in the year since. One X got 20 enhanced BC games at launch, and none in the three months since, right? It seems unexceptionable to say that current trends indicate greater support for VR. Of course Microsoft could begin releasing tons of enhanced BC games in the future and change that, but my projection is based on present facts.  And the fact that PSVR requires extra hardware would be a reason to expect greater support, not less. If no further enhanced BC games ever released, the only real hit to Microsoft's revenue would be virtual, the lost opportunity to sell those games. One X would still retain the great majority of its attractiveness and sales, which is fundamentally based on current-gen games.  If no more enhanced VR games released for Pro, the hardware itself would lose attractiveness. Not all, but there'd be an impact. Since Sony derives revenue from that hardware as well as the games sold for it, they have more incentive to foster development of enhanced VR games. That doesn't mean they , or won't encounter resistance--Vita springs to mind--but it does mean the VR hardware requirement is an impetus to more support, not less.  Sure, the same intent underlies their unenhanced BC initiative. But while that's vastly more extensive than the enhanced list, it's also nowhere close to universal. Clearly there are either technical or permission issues preventing most games from appearing.   But even if imperfect, that project has bloomed well, at a pace that makes enhanced BC compare unfavorably. A month after initial BC, the library increased by about 15%, and a month later by another 8% or so. This hasn't slowed on average, with a further ~350 games added in the next two years. Put that against enhanced BC, which has added nothing in three months.  Again, I'm not saying it could never speed up. Just that right now, it's notably slow."

catpurrcat,2018-02-24 18:40:03,0.9644,quote,Positive,"See point below  ^Exactly this! Well said.   Since I was the original person who made the point about overwatch on the X, I wasn’t saying it was exactly like a 4k high end PC. I was just making a bland statement of admiration, that the significant yet still incremental visual bump on the X generated similar enthusiasm in me that my PC-playing colleagues mention regularly about multiplat games.  As New Fang noted, it’s pretty darn close to the typical PC gaming rig. Sure, on ERA we’re gonna see more users with frequently upgraded PC specs, but the resolution and performance on the X certainly holds well to PC builds up to twice its price (which is admirable, IMO).   I just wanted people in this specific thread to give it a look if they haven’t already. It deserves the spotlight as a stellar X port."
Powerofthecloud,2018-02-24 18:41:13,0.9222,quote,Positive,"No its not better than 1080/ti rig for example but for what the 6tf amd card puts out its pretty impressive for the price, for you to find something that can match its visuals your looking at probably twice as much. So yeah with an unlimited ceiling pc will always win the tech battle so going on about it is redundant. But as it stands right now for $500 you can not make or purchase a new pc that will come close to it visually."

Both are X enhanced. Halo 5 looks ace and runs smooth as butter. Fallout 4 is Fallout 4 and last I checked the bump to 4k (or pseudo-4k) along with the improved graphical settings meant the game actually ran slightly worse than on base X1 but at least it does look way better now."

A friend of mine who never notices that stuff said it was happening to him too. The Pro version didn't stutter at all in campaign, and only stuttered in MP during galactic assault. Blast was flawless, which is my go to mode.  In other news, Mafia 3 was on sale for $15 digitally on gamestop's website, so I picked up a copy. Very disappointed to see the X version again not performing as well as the Pro. The resolution did seem higher, which was nice, but there was a slight microstutter when driving, and the beginning when walking through the mardi gras crowd, it became very choppy. I was so mad that I turned around and bought the PS4 version too just to do direct comparisons, lol. The Pro remained solid during the previously mentioned segment and no stutter. It did appear softer though, and makes my Pro sound like a jet engine, but yeah. So now I own it on both systems digitally, lol."

But the overall image quality isn't as high as that number would suggest. To begin with, filtering is set low (I'd say 4xAF), and the textures in general are less sharp than you'd probably want for a 4K image (though some are higher). In addition, the shadow maps are low-res, and the chainlink fence texture too thin to be seen even at relatively close distances. And there may be some sort of aggressive post-process AA involved (perhaps TAA?), because distant trees and zombies seem much blurrier than they should. The game as a whole really doesn't seem to be reaping the rewards of its pretty high buffer size.   Of course, these shots are only from one tiny area. It's quite possible the game is sharper elsewhere, or that it runs dynamically and these shots are coincidentally from a dip in performance."

HBK,2018-03-01 11:34:31,-0.1356,quote,Negative,"Most game renderers use some form of HDR technique internally. I mean it's extremely common for at least 10 years. What happens most of the time is that this internal ""HDR rendering"" is ""converted"" (usually via tone mapping) so that it can be displayed on, well, ""standard displays"".  If you can hack the game renderer to disable this tone mapping function you can effectively obtain an HDR image straight from the internal buffers.  It's not always possible (I mean easily feasible) for a host of reasons I won't detail here, but in theory most older games could see a enhancement ""patch"" (hack) to enable HDR. I mean it's there in the first place, the game just doesn't display it directly.  Of course I'm not saying it's easy or anything, but it's not surprising to see such enhancements. HDR is somewhere in there, it's just a matter of how the final stages of the pipeline are setup and how it could work to skip tone mapping to display HDR more-or-less directly."

Edit: stupid question but how do you tag someone so they are notified when they are mentioned? I've done it before but not sure how.  The problem is you're assuming every developer has a choice in what type of support they can give to a game. Remedy isn't a huge studio, and they are likely already all hands on deck with their next title. So expecting them to just change things around for an update is unrealistic and unfair to them. They still need to honor the current contract they are under no matter how badly they may want to work on QD or any other game."

Swanlee,2018-03-03 20:59:26,0.9111,quote,Positive,All unpatched games get 16XAF applied and if they have scalable Res and FPS will run at their max setting. Games with locked res and framerate will run at those settings but not go above it while still having 16XAF applied. So worst case is 16XAF applied and smooth frame rates at max res the game supports. You will also get much better loading times and textures fills  Because of this alot of unpatched games will retroactively run and look better than the PS4 versions even if at the time the PS4 version was superior when compared to the original Xbox One

DJ Lushious,2018-03-05 11:05:38,0.9826,quote,Positive,"I still can't get over how great OG Xbox and 360 games look on the X. Over the weekend I was able to play a few more BC titles: Gears of War 3 and Ninja Gaiden Black. Before then I had played Assassin's Creed and Forza Horizon. Assassin's Creed was my first X-Enhanced 360 title and was immediately floored that a 10 year-old title could look that good rendered at 2160p. Then Forza Horizon is a showcase title; the detail truly shines and the game is so crisp and clear.  Gears of War 3, though the textures can show their age, looks stunning, as well. I've beaten all of the Gears games on Insane (solo), but, for one reason or another, never actually finished my Insane run on Gears 3. So, that's what I'll be seeing it through to the end.  And wowzers at Ninja Gaiden! The UI suffers, but beyond that it's like I'm seeing a game I truly loved back in the day for the very first time. The biggest mind-blow I experienced is that on Ryu's village ninja outfit his shoes have steel toes on them and the you can make out the steel links. A ""modern"" playthrough of Ninja Gaiden is now on my list. I've updated the OP with the enhancements listed on Microsoft's Enhancement page, but, as usual, it's the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully there will be a lot more information available tomorrow when the games released.  That's where I got my information from. Anyone else that owns Slime Rancher, would you mind firing the game up and confirming HDR is absent, please?  I just beat the main game 100% last night and I'm really considering getting the $5 DLC. I had a good enough time that I'd feel great playing through more of the game and supporting the Devs, since I got the game through GamePass."

So I'm going to continue my X playthrough and even bought the season pass from Gamestop for $15. The DLC's are supposed to be good and I already love the base game.

It's not X enhanced but man does it look crisp and smooth, well until you get to Velika where there's a lot of players. In terms of aliasing you'd almost think it is X enhanced. 60fps, albeit with some stuttering even in the starting area but I'm impressed. I'd love for them to enhance this for X.  As for Sea of Thieves, I am certain Rare will release a smooth game. I can't imagine them messing that up, not after the praise the game has received so far and the game is quite important for them and MS too. The betas without X enhancements were fine."

Oddly enough, it didn't seem to have any connection to action on screen. One I noticed first was walking past a particular torch in a cave, another was a group of three trees near a fisherman's grave. But nothing popped up in the thickest foliage or three-ship sea battles, or even a crowd of skeletons in the skull-cloud fort.  Still very impressed, but they'll want to iron that out before release.  Edit: I was playing the end of Act 3 last night, and post-patch Quantum Break has too much screen-tear in story scenes for my taste. All the other glitching is cleaned up, and it looks great, but the tearing kills the presentation."

The only difference with some headphones is that they simulate Dolby/DTS through the headset but with Atmos & Sonic, it is simulated through the console and then sent to the headset. For what it’s worth, Atmos sounds great in the games that support it. Works really well in AC Origins. It sounds great in unsupported games too but not all, as I tried it with Wolfenstein 2 and the sound was lacking compared to Sonic. Atmos does cost 15 to use in the store but works on all headphones like Sonic. It’s worth the 15 imo. Some headsets do come with a voucher for it though.  Also, I have the Threshers and they are a phenomenal set of cans. They’ve got an awesome soundstage and are by far the most comfortable gaming headset I’ve ever used. The direct wireless connection to the Xbox is also great.

Dr. Zoidberg,2018-03-16 15:50:56,0.2263,quote,Positive,"Non-HDR (i.e. SDR) games will usually output in 8-bit RGB 4:4:4 with that option unchecked. If it is checked then the Xbox will encode into YCC 4:2:2 since it is less data and may not result in drop-outs or black screens if a user has a cable or other device that cannot keep up.  HDR games are always 10 or 12-bit (usually 10) in YCC 4:2:2 or 4:2:0. HDR doesn't use RGB encoding, at least not so far. 4K/60 10-bit RGB would be more bandwidth than the current HDMI specifications allow."

XxLeonV,2018-03-16 19:45:40,0.9676,quote,Positive,"No prob! I have the regular because it was 100 dollars cheaper. Yeah basically all gaming headsets work with Atmos and Sonic since the Xbox is performing the simulating. Sonic is free and sounds better than stereo to me in most cases.  The Ultimate has Dolby 7.1 and comes with the charging base but otherwise they are the same headset. The base is actually what simulates the Dolby 7.1. I figured since the Xbox has Atmos for $15, that Dolby 7.1 and charging base isn’t worth $100 more. The base does look cool and would make for quick and easy charging though.  The regular Threshers are actually newer and connect to the Xbox directly where as the Ultimate Threshers have to connect to the base and the base connects to the Xbox. Not a big deal but I switch between two Xbox Ones at my house sometimes....so it’s easier not having that base.  One cool feature with Atmos for headphones is that it pops the badge in Netflix. So it works for the movies that offer an Atmos soundtrack on there as well."

Overwatch is only Atmos on PC sadly. Think I might try Tomb Raider here in a bit now that you’ve mentioned it.

XxLeonV,2018-03-16 20:24:05,0.992,quote,Positive,"Ah, got ya. Would love to hear what Overwatch sounds like on Atmos but I’m console only.  It’s basically a license that unlocks Dolby Atmos for Headphones that then simulates it and sends that to headset. I think there is a trial. Mic quality is great according to my friends. Better than the A50s mic that’s for sure. I have one friend who uses the A50s and he often sounds muffled. The Threshers mic can even slide in and out which is nice. I’ve had no connection issues at all. I did get some dropouts when I walked further away from the console (like to my bedroom) but that’s expected. I sit about 6 to 8 feet from the tv and it works perfect at that range. Also it seems that a few reviews out there stated these headphones don’t have mic monitoring but they do. You just have to enable it every time you power them on. You just press and hold the volume button in until it beeps.  I also apologize if I was derailing the thread. Still salty that Battlefield never got an update as I sold my PS4 copy for the X copy. Oh well, I’m not going to put much time into that shooter this year anyway. I do hope Sonic Mania gets an ehnahcement like the Pro since they are putting out that new DLC for it. I know it won’t look much different but I would like it to display in 4K nonetheless."

I have a 5.2.4 home theater system, so I can’t speak on the effectiveness of it being utilized in headphones, but I find the enveloping soundscape to be so engaging and fun! With video games, as opposed to movies, I find that ATMOS is purely being used as the sound objects in the 3D space. Whereas in movies it’s that, but also ambience and the musical score.   The only ATMOS games I’ve played, though are Super Lucky’s Tale all the way through, and a little bit of Gears 4 and FFXV. So, I could be very wrong about ambience and music not being utilized from my limited experience."

Literally all it had that is worth taking away: ""We haven’t made any announcements about an Xbox One X enhancement patch at the moment. If we do have news to share on this one then it will be posted on the official social channels.""   The reason a game goes on the Xbox.com/enhanced website is that Microsoft got notification from the developer that an enhanced patch is in development. Coming soon also means they got notification from the developer that the update is coming soon (not sure what the actual threshold is for that). They don't just put stuff on there randomly.  There has been an obvious delay in the patch's release (or some sort of miscommunication as to why it went to Coming Soon, maybe that was a mistake even) with no word from Capcom, but I doubt the patch has been cancelled. This is not the first patch to be listed on the Xbox.com/enhanced site before an official announcement from the developer. See The Division for instance."

I would agree if it was not the same is it was in the last beta, so I don't think it is network related, especially the screen tearing. I am not sure how anyone at Rare or MS let this get out the door the way it is. As far as performance, depending on your PC hardware, it looks like as of right now it is PC>Xbox One/S>Xbox One ""X"". That should not be happening."

When the beta on X performed so badly I thought it was a given that it would be fixed before launch. Especially because Rare acknowledged it too. But if not, it's just bullshit. This is one of their flagship exclusives.   The X should easily be able to handle it."
Hawk269,2018-03-19 16:51:00,0.8986,quote,Positive,"I agree with you. It was smooth, tear free until the last beta and they added the ""X"" enhancements. So if you are an ""X"" owner and you play this game, performance wise you are getting the worse version...until it is fixed. I wish I could revert the game and be allowed to play it on my ""X"" without the ""X"" enhancements until they fix it. Seeing screen tearing (repeatable) when raising the anchor or when in a tavern or building amongst other areas on top of the slowdown takes you out of it. It won't stop me from playing tomorrow, but I do wish they had this sorted for release. Having your biggest game of the year on your most powerful console and it is performs worse than your base model version is not what should be happening."

Usually MS studios is pretty decent when it comes to fixing things in their games aren't they? You'd think they would have looked into it after they answered the critique about the beta on X.

So I concluded that the framerate and tearing issues were the difference that made me feel nauseous.   Obviously I wish I didn’t feel like this. I genuinely loved what I played previously.  I’ll still give it a shot tonight and see if it was just me being sick for another reason that day, and maybe I just associated it wrongly to the game."

They are still having fun, but with that caveat. Rare knew of the issues during the beta. There may have been other priorities or perhaps they have not figured out how to fix it. Maybe there is a day one patch, I don't know. What I know is that some are not too happy and having a big game performing worse on your flag ship title is not a good scenario. Once DF starts their analysis and if it is not fixed that is going to be egg on both Rare and MS face."

I'm not claiming to have a magic Xbox and I'm really sensitive to tearing and framerate issues, so I'm assuming it's either because I'm playing solo or there's something else going on. Have those with issues tried restarting their X? Are they playing solo?

The thing, though, is that the ISF standards are for the reproduction of film. It just doesn't make any sense to me to apply those settings to a video game.  It's a conundrum, since there is no equivalent standard to video games, but they're also not a film medium. So, I wind up using my TV's Game mode and have been happy with those results across the sets I've owned throughout the years.   I'm not saying you're wrong, just vocalizing how I've analyzed the idea and what resolution I've personally come to."

It’s actually great to see them make that video, it’s a shame the game is having issues but the video has renewed my faith in Rare. VGTech has released a video where sometimes it’s fine and sometimes it’s not in the same area as some said here.   Haven’t had time to watch the entire video but it’s mostly what I’ve been talking about, spots of random couple FPS drops with tearing regularly. It doesn’t make the game unplayable like I’ve said in previous posts but it’s definitely enough to make the experience dissapointing for me. You can see it drop to 25FPS for prolonged periods of time in the video. Something to note is VGTech made a comment that performance is inconsistent even in the same areas. I would make a thread but seeing as how it’s getting fixed in a week Id rather we wait to see how the fix goes."

Does Elex run at 30fps in Performance mode or is it 60fps with drops (or sub-60fps)? And for Resolution mode is it 30fps?      Now it's not 100% guaranteed, but I found when pulling games off Microsoft's Enhanced list if they were listed as ""4K"" they were 2160p, and if not, then they were some resolution below that.

MosquitoSmasher,2018-03-26 10:19:24,0.9716,No quote,Positive,"Question for the Sea of Thieves players about HDR here.  When you play it in HDR on your TV does it look like this:    I mean how bright everything looks, from the light green trees to the sand looking proper too in terms of colours. It looks exactly like this for me with SDR but with HDR the trees are dark green, the sand looks dark yellow and overall just seems to change the overall visuals a bit too much. It's quite a drastic difference and many times I actually prefer the SDR look, the one in this video.  Is this just my TV or do trees, beaches, water, sky etc look darker of colour for you too in HDR?  EDIT  I'm just gonna have to accept it because other things look vastly better in HDR. Went inside one of the shops with SDR, lighting didn't look proper at all, just flat and such. With HDR however it was dark where it should be dark and bright where it should be bright, looked very moody and good.  I'm just gonna have to accept that I won't be having those light green trees, seems the developer intentionally chose for this darker color."

Class 4 events seem to be too fast for the resolution scaler so there are more drops in these events. The difference is still night and day. Previously the game had massive problems.

Which is really dissapointing as it hard locks to 900p in multiplayer and parts of the campaign (and is dynamic 1080p elsewhere).   Something I really hope Microsoft implements is an OS level feature to force non-Enhanced games to run at 4x resolution and 16x AF. This is possible to force on PC with DirectX X86 so I wonder how possible this is on Xbox. Would be a dream come true for those games that will never be patched!

As for BC games, the only ones that natively run at 4K are those patched to do so."

Ubisoft and Bethesda are turning out to be major drivers of my Xbox One X experiences since launch, but I am hoping The Division, Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs 2 and Prey see enhancement patches in the near future. I'd also like to see Fallout 4 get a performance update, maybe take the res down to lock in the 30fps target. I'd like Evil Within 2 to get an HDR update, too, but like Prey and Watch Dogs 2, I suspect low sales, particularly on Xbox, are preventing devs and publishers from committing post release support at this time. After finding myself quite surprised with the quality of Wildlands on my X, I'm hoping to revisit The Division with all its post launch updates and game changes with some X enhancements, but I think the dev might be too tied up on Div2 development to allocate the resources. :/  Oh well, still satisfied with most of what we've got, and I'm still eager to replay FFXV, Witcher 3 and now Doom on my X!

It really shows.  DICE really never gave away a proper reason why they havent updated the game. And i just dont understand it either. Games older than BF1 got updated properly for the OneX but for whatever reason it wasnt possible for BF1.  But BF1 IMO needs more than just a res bump.

I would really like to know if there are technical hurdles that prevent the patch, maybe compiling issues, or perhaps a contractual o financial reason why this patch isn't happening.

EvilBoris,2018-03-29 11:20:12,0.9678,quote,Positive,"Sea of Thieves for HDR. Because it’s not super realistic graphics it’s far easier to separately the “graphics” or resolution from the HDR. Something I suspect people can’t easily do when it’s something as overall impressive as Horizon or GT Sport.  The Witcher 3 is a fairly basic implementation and has some issues with hard clipping highlights. There is no doubt the game benefits from HDR overall,but I don’t believe it’s the best example because of those issues and lack of more adjustable tone mapping.   Assassins Creed Origins has fantastic HDR and amazing graphics that look really great in 4K As does Tomb raider  Games with lots of Foliage really show off 4K really well, Ghost Recon and Far Cry both do this really Well. Steep also has fantastic real-time lighting and atmospherics that really benefit from HDR."
peppermints,2018-03-29 11:32:07,0.8689,quote,Positive,I agree with this. I booted it up for the first time last night since it's on Gamepass. The opening looks incredible with all of the fire and explosions at night. I just wish I liked the gameplay more to see what all it has to offer.  Gears also has a cool feature that does 'split screen' with HDR on and HDR off that does a good job of showing the difference.

Though selfishly, PVP solo is pretty fun right now, because you're unlikely to come across any other players, get the big PVP multiplier, but there's still that risk that there's one other agent in there.

AegonSnake,2018-03-29 15:17:21,0.9958,No quote,Positive,"hey XBox X Nation, got an Xbox X this week. should be here by tomorrow. Been a disgruntled Xbox One owner since launch but I'm excited to try out native 4k games on the X1X. Tired of the 1440p games on the Pro.  Just have a few question for you all.  - Game pass sounds like a deal too good to be true. $10 a month? really? I looked at their website and they have like a hundred games. Are the 360 games on the list all playable on the X1X? Can I really play Mass Effect 1 for free at 4k? - Sunset Overdrive was my 2014 GOTY but i havent heard of an X1X patch for it. Does that mean it gets a boost to at least 1080p?  - The EA pass is another too good to be true deal. I already have most of the EA games on my PS4 but if its just $30 a year and has all last year games then why the hell not? - I disliked Halo 5 a lot. Is it worth replaying at 4k HDR? Is the Master Chief collection in 4k? I never finished my Halo 2 anniversary campaign and I love Halo 3. 4k 60 fps halo 3 would be amazing. - I fucked up and forgot to backup my save files before i traded in my launch x1 this week. I dont plan on replaying any of these games, but with Rise of Tomb Raider, i would like to go back and get 100% in the game. Is everything saved on the cloud even if i am not a XBL Gold member? - Best X1X enhanced games? I have gears 4 already. Is Horizon going to be on XBL or Gamepass soon?  Thanks in advance."
Ready2Rokk,2018-03-29 15:22:10,0.975,quote,Positive,"- Game Pass is a great deal if you don't have those games and like the Netflix model. But don't expect to play old games at 4K. Unless they have been updated, it won't make a difference. - Sunset Overdrive plays the same as it did with the X1. No patch, no differences. Still 900p. - EA is a great deal especially with extended demos of new games - Halo 5 in 4K is super nice. MCC in 4K is coming later this year. - All your game saves for your account should be saved in the cloud even without Gold - Assassin's Creed Origins is nice on X1X. Others may have their favorites. Not sure if FH3 will be GwG or Gamepass soon. Maybe when FH4 comes out, likely late this year. But actually I expect FH4 to be a GamePass game since it is internal and they said all internal games will go there on release."

Though story doesn't change. e) Unlike the 360 all Xbox One games have a cloud backup even if not Gold f) Best X1X enhanced games: RotTR, TW3, FH3, FM7, ACO, GhostReconWildlands, FarCry5, Gears4 (Gfx showcases)"

Not sure about GamePass games tho, but this games could be got for free, I bought a RE7 Gold Edition for, 30 bucks in here (Czech Republic)  Hope you find that useful..."

On a side note I was worried about the AA batteries for the controller but after buying these   For 22.5$ , they are much much better and cheaper than buying a charge kit , two pairs last a ludicrous amount of time and when they are depleted I just pop a charged pair , no need to wait for charging, actually much better than the DS4 solution."

You do get performance boosts though, so if you want an Xbox for  games either way and you don't ssssuper mind shelling out extra, there are tangible benefits of playing whatever you wanna play on the X instead. The Pro was slower on the ""boost"" uptake, so I understand feeling burnt there."

I have a regular PS4, and while I think 4k is amazing, I don't really use the PS4 enough to justify the upgrade to a PS4 pro, especially since I just use it for major PS4 exclusives. I've been playing Uncharted Lost Legacy recently and it still looks amazing, so I'm leaning towards holding off until the PS5."

space_nut,2018-04-04 13:52:51,0.0,quote,Neutral,I'd say this is most likely causing the AO issue. AO is a screen space effect and relies on res/pixels to apply the effect. So there could be a issue where upping the res can cause the AO buffer to not increase causing lost of coverage

However, it seems the game renders almost all detail at effectively* 1080p resolution. I believe this is an intentional effect generated to support the cel shaded look, thickening details to make them look like brushstrokes. It applies to all characters, enemies, and terrain (though a few sharper details do get displayed).  *It's not precisely 1080p where all detail is 2x2 quads. Rather, colors are generally in blocks that size but with a lot of single-pixel noise (which likely isn't visible in action due to the game's depth-of-field and motion blur effects)."

I cannot stomach games where the fps constantly fluctuate between 20s and 50s.

I didn't think it'd be the case, but this shelf of mine is going to get some attention again!    Sea of Thieves is a reference HDR title, in my opinion. Not only are the brights amazing (that sunset and its reflections on the water!), but the darks are stunning. The level of detail that can still be seen at night against the pale light of the moon is bewildering. For even more impressive HDR at night, pull out your lamp. The localization of the bright lamp while the rest of the night environment remains dark is a shining (hehe) display of what HDR brings to our displays.  And you even formatted it for me!

The post-processing does minimize the more obvious resolution gap, though.  Not that you run into those skyboxes often playing, but AFAIK, that's a universal problem."

Still though, i would love to play the first one at least in 4K on the Xbox One X. If i remember correctly, cutscenes are 900p on Xbox One, so i have no clue if the Xbox One X changes that, and to be honest, 1080p during gameplay and the 16xAF included, didn't help it in my opinion. This game deserves a enhancement patch, even if only for the resolution, i don't even mind the 30fps locked. And if they eventually releases a patch on both consoles, Xbox One X will probably have the best version, so it will be the best place to play the trilogy.  I mentioned Shadow of Mordor. Shadow of War is already out, if they didn't release the patch so far, probably they never will, which is a shame, because i have this same dilemma, Shadow of War is marginally superior on Xbox One X, while Shadow of Mordor is superior on PS4 Pro and i wish i could have the series on a single console."

Deleted member 12635,2018-04-14 06:09:58,0.3995,quote,Positive,If you natively render at 2160p you don't need temporal reconstruction because you already have rendered all pixels possible. TI is used if you render less pixels than you would do natively to reconstruct the missing pixels (just like you do with CBR) .That is the reason I am doubting those observations/statements of VG Tech are entirely correct.  Edit: To not derail the thread any further I hope there will be something by DF soon (-->  )

At those times when it drops from 2160p it uses temporal reconstruction to maintain the perception of a 2160p image. TI is a method of temporal reconstruction as is CB for that matter. They might not necessarily be using TI. Also nothing stops you from using dynamic resolution with a temporal reconstruction technique, TI included, with the native resolution going up and down."

TL;DR: They use TI to achieve a full 2160p image in cases the native resolution scales down instead of just upscaling it.

ganaconda,2018-04-14 11:30:01,0.5267,quote,Positive,"Yea I could see how that could be confusing. I haven't researched the technique, but intuitively I would actually expect it still uses TI when it is at 2160P, not to reconstruct the current frame as it doesn't need to, but to use for future frames that may drop below 2160P. I would think that would make the reconstruction even better if you had full 2160P frames in your rolling frame collection for reconstruction. Also if you didn't do this you'd be screwed when you first dropped below 2160P as you'd have no frames to reconstruct from. Someone who has more knowledge of the technique, feel free to correct me. I just made all that up, but I'm a pretty experienced software engineer and that's how I would expect those situations to be handled."

Ninja Gaiden Black was the only other OG Xbox title I've played and, while it's also a looker, Conker is such a different style and a technical showcase in a different way. Conker had what appeared to be 16x AF. I'd imagine every other OG Xbox title gets the same ""upgrade,"" but I don't remember Microsoft ever explicitly stating so.  I also had a chance to pop in Red Dead Redemption. The textures can sometimes scream ""made for 720p,"" but everything about the game is jaw-dropping in 4k.

Taking this kind of needless, unfunny dig at them is shitty. It's completely unprofessional. It's like if you and I were friends and at different companies and I was like ""yeah, man. I talked to some people and I can get you guys in to see x, y and z"" then the next day you turn around and call me an asshole across your social media. That's a shitty thing to do.  Should fans get upset? No. Did someone from Microsoft get upset and send a word to IGN? Abso-fucking-lutely. Did someone need to apologize in a professional manner to try and mend that bridge?

Rodhull,2018-04-20 15:48:11,-0.7564,quote,Negative,That is not even remotely comparable to the IGN post.  Going by this logic games sites can’t possibly offer any opinions on any company if they wish to have any potential relationship with them. Making a joke out of something that games sites have been saying regularly for at least a year should not be this level of a controversy. If it is then almost every gaming podcast i listen to will need to be issuing apologies shortly. Now granted IGN is in a unique position given its size and it does get more exclusives than almost any outlet besides Game Informer but if it’s really the case that companies are that sensitive that they would restrict access to them due to their content then i don’t think thats something we should be championing as consumers even if it is realistically how the world works.  What if Sony/EA/Microsoft/whoever has a really shitty E3. Should IGN not mention it in a serious or joking manner then? Of course not but to me that would do more damage to the companies reputation than a mild joke that should have been forgotten about almost immediately if people had any sense.

Gears 4 and Uncharted 4 were both agony :)  Also, 30fps Xbox One version just means the PC version will beckon more, and Xbox players are stuck playing the definitively second best version of .

However Crackdown is a big budget game and they will want to recoup that cost while eventually profiting. They need to hunt a marketing campaign, announce a release date, and do what they could to make sure people are aware it's releasing on Xbox, PC, and GamePass.  Also not sure if you meant a surprise launch exclusively on GamePass first, but that also wouldn't be a great idea. That would guarantee the smallest overall launch, excluding all pre-orders (digital or physical) while also upsetting retailers.  The whole idea reminded of the surprise Saturn launch in 95 and we all know that didn't turn out well. =p"

Last night I had the game come to a crawl, maybe 15fps (complete guesstimate). I had the game speed set to max and was zoomed in almost all the way in, but not quite, and was working on a troublesome traffic spot. It wasn't any more or less of a taxing scene than other parts of my map and it lasted for about 10-15 seconds before I slowed the game down and it righted itself. I wasn't able to reproduce it, either.  I'd chalk it up as a fluke, but I do think the OP should be updated with ""minor dips.""   The only good indication of a games' ""Enhancement"" status is the OP. Haha!"
HBK,2018-04-24 10:16:30,0.4243,quote,Positive,It should be expected that most games which got full-on 4k res from 1080p would end up with a similar performance profile.  4 times the power. 4 times the pixels. Should be about the same performance (even if X1X may be slightly more powerful overall than 4 times due to GDDR5 and other optimizations).
DJ Lushious,2018-04-24 14:49:34,0.8946,quote,Positive,"I didn't get to Cities: Skylines until it came out on GamePass, so I was very much spoiled by the additional resources X provides to base games.

Rise had a third mode on top of those two; 4KCB/30 with beefed up graphical settings. It was the best way to play the game. There's no way they can do native 4k or locked 60fps with high graphical settings. Maybe the 4k mode isn't native, but checkerboard or dynamic with the graphical settings like Rise?"

A developer has to update the game to the latest XDK version in order to increase resolution.  To do the same with un-patched Xbox One games you would need a similar emulation layer for those games. But as Xbox One games make use of the full CPU spec of a OG Xbox One that layer would introduce performance issues because it would definitely require additional CPU resources and I am not sure if the up-clock of the CPU in the X is sufficient to do it.. In result for example frame times would possibly suffer by default.
Railgun,2018-05-06 07:39:56,-0.0575,quote,Negative,"Have a source on this? Afaik this isn’t how rendering works, it’s feasible to do the same thing with BC games as it is with unpatched Xbox One games. In the same way that they force VSync and 16x AF on unpatched games. On PC you can force games to render at higher resolutions that the game doesn’t support at the rendering level with DirectX. It’s not a foolproof solution however and can cause visual issues but it’s not impossible. I feel Microsoft would rather just let devs manage their own games that aren’t legacy software yet."

Inside that layer 360 API calls are translated into Xbox One API calls including if enabled the translation between original resolution and target resolution (via a virtual GPU in software) and other adjustments specifically for the game.  Each BC game comes with its own BC layer that encapsulates the 360 game to achieve the following two things: That the Xbox One thinks it runs a Xbox One game and the 360 game thinks it runs on a 360.

For the second part this is how it would normally work in software. You need another (abstraction) layer of software that executes the translation from original resolution into the higher target resolution. New software layers means more CPU time as that (layer) code must be executed on top of the normal game code.

pswii60,2018-05-15 09:47:20,0.9311,quote,Positive,Looks 900p to me. Pro version looks better as it received a stealthy patch around the same time it hit PS Plus - I think that's around 1440p now.  Overall though I'm very happy with X patches so far - I think MS confirmed it's over 200x games patched already? I also like how many indie games have already seen X patches. We should finally start to see what X is really capable of later this year when some of the big third party games hit - especially those with MS marketing deals where they're putting in a bit more effort (eg Shadow of the Tomb Raider).

I bought the X mainly for third party games, but sadly there hasn't been much decent third party stuff since the X launched just six months ago.  All that's changing soon though, and the X will come in to its own with some of the third party big guns that are on the way. That's why I'm not too fussed whether Microsoft has much first party on the way this year, as the X will be where I'm playing 90% of the time regardless."

But Cyberpunk is right up there too. Also DMC5, although if rumours are true I'll be playing that one on my Pro.  But also looking forward to indie stuff too. I really hope Playdead unveils their next project - I'm playing through Inside right now for the first time and I'm absolutely loving it - to the point that I'm almost pondering on it being my GOTG. Unlike most here, I don't think GoW is particularly impressive from a technical standpoint. It's impressive because of the phenomenal art direction. I'm still yet to complete the game though (currently Between the Realms)."

Hope the DMC5 rumors are lies, give me that on X. Also want to know what that action adventure for Xbox from Capcom is."

SimpleCRIPPLE,2018-05-20 00:56:03,0.8374,quote,Positive,"PUGB doesn't have an Atmos mix. The Xbox is screwed up right now in that if you select Atmos output, the Xbox output all games as Atmos, regardless of whether or not the source material was mixed to support Atmos. For any material that isn't mixed for Atmos specifically (of which there are like 5 games. there's an atmosphere group in the store now), you'll get 5.1, but the Xbox isn't capable of using the Atmos height channels unless the game specifically supports it.  Basically, right now its better to set your Xbox to output PCM and let your receiver up mix to Dolby Surround or DTS Neural X so your height channels will actually get something fed to them. And don't worry, even if you set the Xbox to output PCM, UHD discs will still send the Atmos track to your receiver as long as you have the ""let my receiver decode audio"" option enabled for Blu-Ray playback."

The PS4 Pro, at best, would get a framerate increase via Boost Mode, if there were any dips.  9 times out of 10 I am going to pick resolution, but Rise of the Tomb Raider is that 10th time where I pick Enhanced. 2160c rendering is a small tradeoff from a full 2160p to get extra graphical effects."

I played through the entire game and just had a blast. Funny thing is the 4k version basically makes the game look how i remember it looking. Also, I had a hell of a time trying to scale Wang tower at the end, so i captured a 4k video (4k still rendering as I type this) of me taking the sneaky path from northern outside part the building instead of entering at the bottom south side of the building (which is basically not that fun).   Anyone else playing through Crackdown again?"

One could say that Red Dead Redemption looks garbage on the Xbox 360 and even the X couldn't save it. Now look at the 4k version on Xbox One X. It looks great.  The higher resolution in Siege will change the visuals noticeably.  I think that this definitely isn't their last enhancement patch. They've already stated that another update will change the dynamic resolution. We could see additional enhancements down the line.

That list can sometimes be a little slow in updating, and not every game needs support patched in. I don't know why the developers haven't talked about it.  But to me, the game looks pretty great. It's definitely not native 4k, however. And it seems to have film grain and some post processing that makes it difficult to pin down the resolution. But there is no way in hell the standard Xbox One is running the game looking as it does currently on the X. So some form of enhancement is there already , but I'm not technically inclined enough to be able to go into more detail."

I didn’t even play the demo (heck, I hadn’t even heard of Onrush until this week).  Right now I’m absolutely exhausted from a day of physical labour but I’m wide awake playing it online. Matchmaking on Xbox is incredibly quick, literally a few seconds.  I really enjoy racers, especially arcade ones (Forza Horizon 3 was my favourite), but always burn out on them because of the repetitive nature. This is where Onrush shines. It’s not about getting to the finish line, it’s instead objective based.   It’s like they combined the best features of 90’s arcade racers, burnout, NFS, Forza Horizon, and Overwatch (team based but accessibility for casuals).   I posted in the Onrush OT that I’m baffled it’s not getting more conversation. If there’s DLC one day, this will be my first xbox game I buy DLC/season pass for."

The PC version has just added a dynamic resolution setting.) Filtering seems better. Screen space reflections are now present. Not sure if they're full resolution or half.  I've never understood people who say the Pro enhancements for Prey were ""barely noticable"" compared to the vanilla version and stuff like that. How can you fail to notice A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF REFLECTIONS IN A GAME DOMINATED BY REFLECTIVE SURFACES? Essentially every scene in Prey relies heavily upon screen space reflections. It was pretty clearly designed around them, aesthetically.  Wonder what framerate the game is running at on X? I'm gonna assume 30, but you never know."

Going back to it a few weeks ago just highlighted how incredible the leap in TW3 was. The cartoony art style of RDR just holds up better for me."
StuBurns,2018-06-16 19:42:22,0.8719,quote,Positive,"Funny you mention saturation. I had to dip the saturation and increase the contrast, both by two notches, in RDR to make it look right. The default saturation on my C7 in game mode was surfacing too much of the texture shortcomings. The difference between colour tones within a texture really pop out and highlight their resolutions.  It's certainly still a very beautiful game though. I think W2 holds up better, but RDR is still crazy impressive when you're not up close to something."

Gears 2 desperately needs a saturation slider, it would look so much better with a splash of colour. It's one of the reasons Gears 3 looks so much better to me as well."
UltraGashInferno,2018-06-16 20:05:29,-0.9382,quote,Negative,  Not surprised it's a quick and dirty port. My *hope* is that it doesn't perform worse than PS4 Pro. I have no higher expectations of this version lol  It's shitty this game was such a breakout hit but Square won't change the plan of not allocating a nickel to post-release support outside the bare minimum. I imagine if PG or some other in-house team got even a quarter of the time to tinker with it that Square has given FFXV :(  My PS4 Pro is currently going fucking nuts because I'm idle in a menu in Let It Die and the framerate is probably uncapped in it (because menus having uncapped framerates is a thing in a lot of PS4 games for some odd reason.) Have yet to hear a peep from the One X.

I try to avoid counting titles based solely on developer statements, instead waiting for verification from myself or analysis on the web. So in fact there's another 60+ games listed in my OP that aren't counted. This approach isn't superior, just different...but it does mean you have to do some extra calculation to make a comparison.  Since I also keep a changelog, I can actually approximate how many games with Pro support there were at any particular point. It seems at 220 days the number was almost exactly the same as One X, 187 games give or take a few. Very strange coincidence!   Just a slight correction,  is actually 1728 on One X.

I've also seen no checkerboard rendering artifacts and the artifacts were very noticeable originally. I have some frames that you can pixel count in my video .

I'd say it depends on your existing library on other platforms (I primarily game on PS4) but from here on out until the end of the generation, all multiplatform games (sans exceptions) will be better on XBX. Also, games pass is a fantastic service for affordable gaming. That said, their selection needs to improve further. And then there's EA access (which I haven't subscribed to) which, depending on your requirements, would also be a cost saving measure."

The colour spacing leads to a yellow tint and inaccurate representation.  However PC mode applies the low 21ms latency to all modes including the more accurate ISF bright and dark modes.  It is normally recommended to play SDR content on PC mode using ISF dark/bright (accurate with minimum lag) and switch to game mode (any icon apart from pc) for HDR (accurate colour and lowest latency) if the mode seems too dark, dynamic contrast to medium and use in game settings for better calibration."

I thought I'd show my friend my O&S fight, so I pressed capture, thought it was saved, and it was only thirty seconds, which pissed me off, but fair enough, it's my fault for not looking at the settings and expecting the default to be ten or fifteen like on PS4. Anyway, I found the setting, which seems to top out at five minutes so I picked that. I beat Manus on my first try, so I thought I'd capture it. Just checked and that's a total of twenty-six seconds.  What am I doing wrong, and what is the longest the console can record?"

Like sections of Rime or Recore, etc that had bad frame drops on the OG will no longer have those on the X, even though they don't target high FPS specifically?  The resolution doesn't help me (yet), as I don't have a 4K TV, as that's not in the budget yet. I only have it hooked up to a 720p LCD right now *dives for cover* ;)"

I'll do some more comparisons to make sure its not just placebo effect, but I've been playing a TON of Fallout 4 on my OG since it went on Gamepass, and the second I loaded it up on the X it is very noticeable change to be sharper and smoother than on the OG... even on my old TV. The bad news is, I'm not so sure the X can push a game like Fo4 at 4K, because the framerate is worse than on the OG. As far as I can tell on Bethesda forums there is no way to force 1080p ""performance mode"", it is 4K all the way :(. There are some unofficial performance mods I will give a shot as well. I guess it's not the end of the world because I've loved Fo4 so much I've committed to buying the GOTY on PC (instead of season pass on Xbox), but still I'd be lying if I said that better Fo4 performance wasn't a significant driver for my X purchase, so a bit disappointing here.  Other games are wonderful so far, and the UI is improved as well.Once I finish transferring all of my games from the OG, I'll be able to sell it off and help take away some of the pain of this upgrade, then I'm sure I'll be quite happy with the purchase ;)"

And this is coming from someone who put 30 hours into the PS4 version.  I’m not saying you’re wrong, as I may not be as sensitive to it as you, but your impression is the first I’ve seen about the input lag since the X patch. Can anyone else corroborate this? Any online articles that compare/contrast this particular issue.  Prey is such an unbelievable ride; I’d hate for someone to lose out on that experience, especially at $15.  Side note, I thought the image quality looked fantastic with the X patch.  Okay, I also need some help on deciding on an X Enhanced game that is also on sale. How big of an improvement is Diablo 3 on the X over the PS4 Pro?  I’ve put way, way, way, way, way too many hours into the PS4 Pro version (and slightly less into PC) and am hours away from the Platinum. I gotta admit, I’m tempted to start all over again on the X, but I’m unsure on just how much better an experience it’ll be on resolution alone."

Hey Please,2018-07-26 09:25:00,0.526,quote,Positive,"Correct. Heavy battles see notable drops in both 4K and 1080p modes.  The X has been a disappointment thus far because I have tried two games on it and both of them have significant framerate issues. I played through Rise of the Tomb Raider and the framerate absolutely plummeted at a certain point for a very long duration and the game is plagued with a multitude of momentary dips and some screen tearing. I was convinced that my X was faulty because I could not believe a 6TF console being advertised by MS as the definitive place to play would suffer this badly in comparison to my other console. I was later informed that the specific areas that saw the severe performance drop is terrible on all consoles.  And now EverSpace. When I asked about the game on this forum, I was told it was a highly addictive and fun game on xbox. I chose to trust the member and now I got burned. Again, either that or my X has a deficient CPU and/or GPU because it truly does not provide an experience that is being touted on its behalf.  Edit: The only other game I have played and that thankfully did perform without any notable performance drop was Captain Spirit. However, while it looked absolutely stunning. I do not believe it would be pushing the system as hard as other two games I mentioned."
DJ Lushious,2018-07-26 10:32:58,0.5546,quote,Positive,"You have played three games. Not to discount your opinion, but you should put the onus on the developer for any short-comings.  What mode did you play Rise of the Tomb Raider in? That alone should tell you it's the game/engine and not the system.  Take a look at the OP. Whenever the information is there, I put ""w/drops"" next to the frame rate on a mode, if there is known to be frame rate dips. Obviously that's not a super specific account of where/when the frame rate dips, but it should at least set expectations. So, look at some other titles to showcase your new Xbox One X with.  Gears of War 4 would be my first suggestion, as the performance is solid in 4K, it's a gorgeous game, and I think it's a lot of fun."
Hey Please,2018-07-26 11:32:09,-0.1336,quote,Negative,"Firstly, let me get this out of the way. I should have paid more thorough attention to your list. Second of all, it is not my intention to demean or denigrate your self evident hard work. Please keep up the great work on which so many of us rely.  I was expressing my personal frustration because 2 out of the 3 current gen games I played have performance trouble. When I bought X, I had expected it to be the panacea for console gaming performance (what is the point of 4K if the performance does not meet the base expectation of 30fps?).   With regards to RoTTR, I first played the game on ""Enriched"" mode and later when I got to the really problematic part, I switched to ""Native 4K"" which, to my surprise, was far more playable and stable. Given Digital Foundry's assessment of RoTTR on XB1X was the ""definitive"" version on the said ""Enriched"" mode, I did not expect the game's frame rate to shit the bed that hard. As for the insight I gained later about the performance being problematic on other consoles, I was still disappointed because the X port did not remedy said issue.   I could and perhaps should put the onus on devs. However, in the end, outcome would still remain the same and X would look even worse for it because this signifies that the most expensive console is not getting the proper developmental support making it somewhat irrelevant.   In conclusion, I am glad that the first two reasons I bought the X were 4K backward compatible games (here is me hoping that TW2 and RDR don't shit the bed as well) and 4K BD. I have Halo 5, GeoW4 and Dishonored 2 lined up and hopefully, I will find out if it is my console that's broken or the games I played before were anomalies."

DJ Lushious,2018-07-26 12:15:46,0.9893,quote,Positive,"Well, frame rate sensitivity is a subjective measurement; what may be tolerable to me may not be tolerable to you. And in no way did I take your post as an attack on me or my work. My goal was to, more or less, discuss that there's lots of high-quality Xbox One X experiences out there. I'm sorry you've had such a poor first impression, though.  I wasn't fishing for compliments, either, but I am  happy to hear them. Haha!  I have yet to play Rise of the Tomb Raider on the Xbox One X (my playthrough was on the Pro), but I do want to revisit it. Which area was the most problematic for the framerate? I've always read it was the last area, but I don't remember, I was playing in the 1080p mode, and I'm admittedly not bothered by inconsistent frame rates.  Shadow of the Tomb Raider, both an internally developed project and one catered to a world where these high-performance machines have been out for years, gives me confidence that we'll see a quality experience.  Remember, though, that the Xbox One X has only been out since November 22. During that time the amount of X Enhanced titles has grown tremendously (I'm counting 202 Xbox One titles currently). I think that's an outstanding number in the short 8 months since its launch. Even if we are curiously missing some titles (BF1, anyone?). :P  I can't speak for The Witcher 2 or Red Dead Redemption (I've only played Red Dead through the intro), but the other 3 titles are excellent titles that showcase the X's power.  I've played through Dishonored 2 on the Xbox One X 3 times now and I only experienced one minor framerate dip. It was always in the same spot and I didn't feel it warranted noting in the OP, but I want to share it with you now so you at least have the expectation. During the beginning of the 2nd level, when you are being transported to land, there is a spot where the framerate dips noticeably for about 2 seconds, if that. I'm being vague, so as to not spoil anything, if you've not played it. Otherwise, the game runs flawlessly and looks otherworldly with its 4K textures and 2160p resolution.  Gears of War 3 really shines in 4K. I was constantly amazed that those graphics were generated by the Xbox 360 originally; it still holds up quite well. I also think the Campaign is fantastic, too, but that's just icing on the cake. :P"

I remember that it got delayed for half a year and you can really tell that the extra time got put to good use.

I try and make and sure that there is as little room for misunderstanding as possible, given the lack of tone while gleaning a paragraph of text.  Now, with regards to RoTTR, here is a screenshot of the area where things went notably bad:     The portion right after this where Lara comes across myriad injured villagers subsequent to the fight with Trinity was nigh unplayable on the enriched mode.  As for Dishono(u)red 2, thanks for the heads up. And with regards to the rest of the games, I do hope things turn out for the better since I have not heard of any significant drops in both Halo 5 and GeoW4.  On a side note, I have never been a fan of GeoW series but for the sake of performance, I shall give GeoW3 a try.  I am contemplating getting but I have yet to hear from someone who has played through it on X and can provide some sense of the performance overall in the ""Graphics/Quality"" mode.

If you can find two games on the list you want to play, go ahead and sub. You can always cancel (and resub later) and if you cancel early,  You sound like me where you buy a lot of games and don't really care to play them once you are done with them so Game Pass isn't as attractive to us. That being said, there is no commitment so you can start and stop whenever you see something on the list that you want to play. Also the 3 months for $9 deal is a steal. So yes, even as someone that doesn't see GP as revolutionary, I still say go for it."

I actually think it will happen in the next year or so, like with battlefield 1 but even later in this case. This gives them a next gen version to sell until gta 6 comes out."

Dr. Zoidberg,2018-08-03 12:38:26,0.4817,quote,Positive,"I'm not sure what he's talking about (Brightness? Backlight?) but normally, Black Level is referring to how the TV handles decoding color on 8-bit RGB video signals, which is the standard for console output. There are only two options, just like on your set, and for most people Low/Limited is the most compatible setting. Your game console's settings have to match this but it's the default so unless you've changed it, that's what it should be.  Ironically, HDR doesn't use RGB encoding at all currently so the black level setting is irrelevant. Again, I'm not familiar with his TV but whatever setting he's referring to, it's not the same as Black Level on your TV."

It is also helped by the distance from 2 at this point, and the benefit of having more Fable in what turned out to be a surprisingly Fable-less future for Xbox.

I played a few hours of 4 player split Halo CE, 2 and 3 and all ran absolutely amazing, almost flawless with the exception of bigger Halo 3 maps. Playing four player split screen with each player getting their own full 1080p/60 32” screen is a great experience. Looking forward to Rocket Leagues update"

The IQ was fantastic at 60FPS, also these aren’t cutscenes in the usual sense. For one there is no “cut” in these scenes, they flow in and out of gameplay from first person with no cuts. You can still control the camera and it’s all first person and switches between constantly in the level. This just isn’t what I expect from a COD campaign, CoD has been around for many years and hasn’t done this. Apparently Black Ops 3 tried this but even then that was terrible and the main game ran at 40FPS anyway. Then to top it off you want to patronise me when the cutscenes now have severe tearing and run at an uneven 29-32 FPS? What a joke"

MrBob,2018-08-21 20:35:54,-0.3182,quote,Negative,Yup. I played Rise on X and 60fps was a stuttery mess at times.  I went to 4k enhanced mode which i believe is now missing from shadow of the tomb raider.

Worried we’re about to get the same with the MCC if the bugs they’ve added aren’t fixed in the following week.
Zappy,2018-08-22 04:30:06,0.9781,quote,Positive,"Which is good for me at least. I don't mind a framerate option vs resolution. But it is a console. I want devs to build the prettiest version of the game they can and give it me. I don't want to have to decide if I want the sharpest resolution or the best effects. Maximise something and make those decisions and present it as a ""resolution"" mode.   I get choices are good, but essentially you're letting me decide whether I want the best effects or the highest resolution and neither are optimal. As devs they should set that balance and offer it as a coherent mode. Otherwise I feel like I'm making a choice and a sacrifice no matter what."
Railgun,2018-08-22 04:34:47,0.1779,quote,Positive,Instead you’re not getting balance and instead just get what is essentially the 4K mode from Rise with no option for the Enriched mode. I absolutely would rather take Checkerboard over native any day if it means better graphical settings.
leng jai,2018-08-22 04:35:17,-0.1037,quote,Negative,That makes no sense because you're still making a sacrifice they just aren't giving you an option on what in your scenario. Some people prefer base Xbox settings at native 4K and others prefer higher end settings at checkerboard 4K or 1440p. Absolutely nothing wrong with more options.

Tortillo VI,2018-08-28 09:18:16,0.3919,quote,Positive,Maybe its because animations run at half the framerate? I'm no expert but I remember something like this affecting Halo Anniversary ever since it's 360 release.

leng jai,2018-08-28 19:51:58,0.882,quote,Positive,Well there's a differentiation between better treatment and no treatment. There are indeed some games that have Pro support and not 1X support because the former came out first. Going forward I don't expect any game to support one and not the other. When they are both enhanced 98% of the time the 1X version is objectively better but there are some outliers where some games have pushed the resolution too far on and the Pro ends up having better frame rate.

Yeah there are weird instances where the PS4 version gets an update and the X doesn't and it was still well within the means of the publisher such as with Metal Gear Solid V, Deus Ex, & Mass Effect Andromeda. Tekken 7 is another one where the upcoming season 2 content easily justifies bringing the Xbox version up to snuff but apparently it's not ""worth it"" for one platform."

Koralsky,2018-09-05 18:32:33,0.9845,No quote,Positive,"Hope this is not forbidden - we (two-person core team from Bulgaria) are releasing our Xbox One game... today. The game is called Elea (it is a first-person old-school sci-fi adventure/walking sim) and have a full Xbox One X support. I think the fans of writers like Stanislaw Lem and Arthur Clarke can potentially appreciate the game for what and how the narrative is presented.  The game is using Unreal 4 and it is also console exclusive to Xbox. For both versions, we are using dynamic resolution, but on X we can hit native 4K in Quality mode at a very steady 30FPS (the game is using fully dynamic lighting model - there isn't any static light in the game at all). Performance mode is also using dynamic resolution, but the framerate is targeting 60FPS (so overall the resolution is lower).   Compared to the original Xbox One, X version is using better shadows, better AA, better anisotropic filtering, far better screen space reflections, and post-process profile.  We made a specific profile for the Xbox One X version, tailored to the X hardware and it is very close to ultra settings on PC. In Performance mode, we are lowering just the resolution (for a very steady 60FPS, minus when the game is streaming higher chunks of data and when we ""autosave"") and nothing else. All the fx, shadows and so one are the same as in the Quality mode."

I quite like the narrative so far but visually it’s almost unplayable. The chromatic aberration is painful and I’m not sure if you realised but on a 4k screen the text is so small it is unreadable :(  The textures and effects look good from what I can tell and I love the sound effects but can’t recommend it until a CA toggle is added and the font is enlarged.

Sadly I can't tell you the exact numbers at the moment, but in performance mode, the resolution is gravitating between 1080p to 1440p. With the eventual option to turn on and off some of the post FX, there can be some improvements in the resolution scale in Performance mode, because Elea is post-process heavy game."

I'll see if I can boot it up during the beginning to see if it still has the tearing at least.   Yeah it's a bummer but at least they're not leading people on anymore. Bulletstorm still looks pretty crisp for a 1080p title though and performance is quite good.  Rime on the other hand sadly still has framerate issues even on the X. A bit hard to tell what the resolution is but seems like possibly 1080p, it has a bit of softness to the image and edges so maybe it's using temporal anti-aliasing. It's actually kind of close to Abzu in image quality which doesn't look too bad on XBO or the X but the art would obviously stand out much better at a higher resolution.  Edit: So looking at  on the PS4/Pro versions of Rime it looks like it's not a well optimized game on any of the console platforms & these versions are at 1080p resolution."

But again Shadow of the Tomb Raider is so so clean, didn't spot any aliasing and this is with the same settings. I guess some games just are a little different with that. Different AA tech is my guess. It's not like the aliasing is everywhere, not by any means. Just around the rear lights of the mustang car and grille of other cars I've noticed it.   As for the trees, I said aliasing but it's more like the trees look a bit grainy, but they did in FH3 too.   Next time I'll play the demo I'll try it with reality creation off.

Tomb Raider uses TAA (a very good implementation), so that's why it appears so stable.  MSAA is superior as it doesn't produce any blur like TAA can, but it can still have edges appearing aliased due to the lack of a post process AA to help clean up the final image. I think it suits Forza and racing games more since you wouldn't want ghosting or blurriness in such a fast moving game!"

I don't have that big ass screen for nothing ;)   I saw some people online say it's 720p but no mention if that was both docked and undocked. 720p vs 1080p is quite a difference for me and especially with a 65 inch you easily see that.  I also saw the game is now 12 bucks on Xbox. Cheapest so far?

Jessie.Bristol,2018-09-26 20:32:38,0.1779,quote,Positive,"Yes, every game will have support for FreeSync. Developers don't have to do anything as it is supported at the system level. But many FreeSync monitors only have a range of 48hz - 60hz (or above if using a high refresh rate monitor) and cannot be used in combination with HDR unless you have a FreeSync 2 (aka VRR) display. Some FreeSync displays have a feature called Low Framerate Compensation which helps eliminate tearing if the frame rate falls below 48hz (or the lowest freesync range of the display)."

I've let the intro fully play and I haven't gotten any sound distortions during those portions. As for the gameplay intro area, all the sounds seems to be working including the car alarms/sirens. Best advice I could give you is to try uninstalling the game and rebooting the console and then download the full game again to see if that clears up all the issues. If not try downloading the game into a different hard drive if you're installing it into the same place."
DarkCloud12X,2018-11-07 21:42:17,0.8768,quote,Positive, Oh the stories I have to tell in my quest to resolve this issue. Deleted the game and reinstalled it 3 times on 3 separate drives. Same bug each time. Tried the game on one of the already used hard drives on a different Xbox One X and the intro was dead silent while gameplay was the same as my second video. Tried again on my old X and static all over again.  Finally tried going offline and deleting my save from the console so it couldn't pull my old save from the cloud...now my X had a silent intro and the same sound issues in gameplay. Was ecstatic that i'd made some progress so i played passed the first boss and went into the options to check if there were any different graphics options since i could finally kinda play it. By chance I glanced over at the audio settings and noticed they looked off. Turns out that a fresh save on this game now defaults to the game starting with just sound effects maxed...all other sliders were set to 0. They broke the default starting options lol.  So after cranking those up my game is as I remember it being pre update. It seems my save was somehow causing the distorted audio in cinematics...no idea how but that was the culprit as far as I can tell. I can't wait to go through all this again when they patch deathinitive.

Kage Maru,2018-11-08 00:28:20,0.888,quote,Positive,Cool and I definitely trust you more than me heh. I did get a 3200x1800 count from the opening room though. Used a 36 pixel ruler and counted 30 steps both ways. Maybe they enabled a dynamic resolution for this version? The engine does use the technique in other games. 1800p should be possible if we go by the base consoles 900p resolution. A 4x increase in pixel count should be more than doable. That's why I automatically assumed it to be a possible resolution without actually looking at anything closely =p  Also I tried to look for signs of CBR but I couldn't in the limited pictures I took. I'm wondering if the artifacts you found could be due to the CA in the game? I recall thinking Destiny 2 on the 1X was using CBR due to artifacts when in fact it was the CA causing the combing effect.  Edit: Ok trying it again since I had issues doing this from my phone.  Here's what I used to get the vertical count.     And horizontal:

I need help with a problem on the Microsoft store. When I go into the Games -> browse games section, the category for backward compatibility that used to be there is no longer visible.

Liabe Brave,2018-11-08 02:17:10,0.7901,quote,Positive,"Thanks! And yes, dynamic seems to be what's going on. I also count 3200x1800 in your shots (checking vertical and horizontal in each). But I still get 2880x1620 for the shots posted by  in the dedicated thread. They come from imgur so they're not as pristine, but here's some demonstration of counts. I inset a crop from elsewhere in the same screen so you can get vertical and horizontal together; .     No, I don't think that's the cause. They appear in the center of the image, where CA should be weakest, and don't have any apparent chroma separation. But while I don't think CA is causing the dithering, it may not be CBR either. The way stippling is dispersed across images doesn't appear quite diagnostic to me. Plenty of games without CBR have checkerboard dithering from various other sources.  Whether there's CBR or not, I'd say evidence is good that the game's resolution is dynamic, and accompanied by TAA. It's not possible to say with so few shots whether we've seen the ceiling (or the floor)."

Disappointing but still better than nothing for Xbox gamers.  Odd how I own this on the PC, PS4, and Xbox but can't get into it."

I used very short edges due to the compression, so the differential between the two results is only 1 or 2 pixels. I've continued to count more screenshots, and all of them have been 3200x1800. Even if the game is dynamic, it seems to typically run higher than I first found.  That said, those other screenshots also seem to contain more artifacts suggesting CBR.  especially has stippling in places that look like reconstruction problems. They could still be due to other graphical effects like lighting, but that seems increasingly less likely. My best guess now is that  runs at 1800c on One X."

Liabe Brave,2018-11-09 11:09:51,0.9522,quote,Positive,"Good luck! This is one of the softest games I've seen, with CA and film grain and even an effect that intentionally breaks up edges into painterly flocking. There's a desaturated ""vampire vision"" mode that may be easier to count.  Texture expression is improved on One X versus Pro, though it doesn't really look like different textures. I believe the increased clarity is due to higher resolution. Hints of this can also be seen on more stable thin geometry in the distance. I haven't tried to fully analyze the One X version, though."
Kage Maru,2018-11-09 12:32:38,0.9581,quote,Positive,"I don't know how I missed this before. Was looking into this yesterday and while it could be using CBR, the stippling isn't a clear sign of it because BF1 on the PC also has the same type of artifacts and that version doesn't use reconstruction. However on the other end, we know that CBR is being used in Anthem. So really it could be either. In theory, the game shouldn't need it to reach 1800p, the 1X has more than enough power to quadruple the resolution without any reconstruction needed, but the artifacts do raise questions. It's in instances like this that I wish there was more transparency or details with patch notes.  Yeah that's the impression I also got in the short time I played. It does have a very aggressive TAA implementation. Thanks for the tip on the vampire vision."

Did a count for Vampyr on the 1X and it's being rendered at 1080p, just like the Pro version. Also just like the Pro version, it suffers from frame pacing issues, so I wanted you to be aware of that in case you're sensitive to slight stuttering at times. The gameplay doesn't require good frame timing, so it hasn't hindered my enjoyment even though it sticks out like a turd in a punch bowl to me. Not sure how the individual settings stack up since I don't have any other version to compare it to.   Hope that all helps though.   Really? I was thinking of double dipping for the PC if I really enjoyed the game but I don't think my 1070/2700x set up would provide much more performance than your rig."

I haven't seen many people mention the low resolution volumetric lighting though, can't even remember DF saying anything in the analysis. I'm only running at 1080p but whenever there are a lot of god rays on screen it looks pretty awful.  Hard reset definitely doesn't fix it.  Pretty much plus also other random slowdowns in the open world. Some feel like glitches rather than actual performance issues due to heavy load though. Indoors is the worst though.

What you call a huge difference in Madden is what most would call a trivial difference as the things you're mentioning have absolutely nothing to do with playing the game. Granted, I only have madden 18 on both platforms and the differences there in that version are very trivial. I can't imagine that it's changed all that much in 19."

I'd love a remaster if they can't do an X enhancement since the game would really benefit from higher resolutions, it has excellent lighting & effects.  Btw Observer got a patch today. While it has chromatic aberration and other distortional effects layered on top, the image quality of the objects up close don't have the aliasing of a 1080p game so it looks like it got enhanced.

And the answer will be ""XX is not broken at all, look"" and actually creates situations counter to the intent. I don't think those posters were doing any more than I might in their situation - just expressing discontent in what they likely felt was a general way, but the inclusion of a specific reasoning that is almost never true- - is counter to the effect they intended.  On the flipside if the post I responded to had been ""How hard can it be? A lone hacker fixed an aspect of the HDR on at least one instance of the PC version"" then you'd have a solid and stable foundation for a serious conversation that is more likely to be examined or responded to. It's still not going to be as simple as the hacker fix, because there's a crazy matrix of things that need to be true to roll out code at that scale, but it's a better start.  Future Halo games will support any features we think on balance will lead to a better experience for players. Atmos (audio) is certainly one we're looking at.

Thank gawd for the Xbox One X ""Insects"" app, which to my knowledge is the only software that lets you ensure every component is definitely working simultaneously."

My Atmos ordeal was working with a semi-custom builder whose contractors had never heard of Atmos/DTS-X/etc. Even after sending them Dolby's diagrams for placement (the goal was to have them do the wiring, and I'd install the speakers), they were doing all these weird things like 2 rows of 3 speakers, which...no. Eventually I had to just spray paint on the floor where I wanted the wiring to be placed above. Ever since then, it's been amazing! 5.1.4 right now.

DJ Lushious,2018-12-10 17:53:06,0.9867,quote,Positive,"It may be a paltry week for Xbox One X Enhanced titles releasing this week, but I am utterly thrilled to see the release of one of them. Hint: it's not Kingdom: Two Crowns.  I've updated the OP with the following:      In regards to Below, Nathan Vella, of Capybara Games, explicitly mentions over and over again that Below is 4K and 60fps on the Xbox One X . I find the mention of ""60 fps"" mysterious and unclear, because I couldn't find any information on what the frame rate is on the base console. As with any other title in the OP, I will note the frame rate only if it is increased over the base console, is a part of graphical options available, or is unsteady.  I don't agree with this statement. Is it ideal and what I want? You bet! We have to be real, though, and acknowledge that there are certainly a number of reasons why a developer may choose to forego, or is even unable to, provide additions to their game to take advantage of the Xbox One X (we could even include the PS4 Pro here, too). If we were playing a game of Family Feud I'd guess money, time, and manpower would be the top 3.  Tekken 7 is the one that has been mentioned from many posters here as a disappointment to have not received an X enhancement. Rightfully so, considering the PS4 Pro received an update to the game. Yet, the Director of Tekken 7 stated   I don't know why I've always foregone including Insects: An Xbox One X Enhanced Experience from the OP. I've changed that (see above). The Insects demo is my go-to when showcasing my home theater to friends/family. Atmos and 4K, as tech, are pretty easy ideas to explain, but HDR benefits the most actually in experiencing it, in my opinion. I think the Insects demo does a fantastic job of visually explaining HDR; its use of comparisons, coupled with on-screen commentary, for all 3 tech, makes it a perfect showcase."

DJ Lushious,2018-12-12 12:34:04,-0.2387,quote,Negative," Thanks! It was reported by some others here about a week and a half ago that it got an update and it was reported to look and run better, but no real specifics. I was hoping some more information would be released before I added it to the OP, but hopefully this is a sign we'll get some official word. I've now added it, though. Note that I've listed it as "">Observer.""  It still has dramatic frame rate drops, but I'd not played it before the X patch came out. The times it dips are really odd and seem to occur when you would think they shouldn't; like not a ton of effects on the screen or complexiity to the scene. Admittedly frame rate drops don't bug me (screen tearing bugs me greatly), but they drop pretty low and it is very apparent.  I played the game with my girlfriend watching for about and hour and a half and then she picked up my progress for about another half hour while I made dinner. I really don't know what to make of the game. I really do enjoy Walking Simulators (I'd say ""where's that Firewatch patch?"", but it's been de-listed from Microsoft's list of enhanced titles), but I'm still trying to figure out what the narrative is exactly. I've made it a little past the achievement ""I am an Observer."" So, spoiler questions incoming:   I am in no way saying I don't like the game so far, 'cause I really do. There's just some confusion on my part, really."

DJ Lushious,2018-12-12 12:50:52,0.936,quote,Positive," The best attitude to take is that it's cancelled. BUT...  There's a few examples in OP where the game has been updated out of nowhere and wasn't on Microsoft's list as upcoming in any way, a game has been updated and took some time to show up on Microsoft's list, or has been updated and still remains off Microsoft's list.  I feel  strongly about the ""Any/all Devs who are transparent with their titles' enhancements"" acknowledgment in the OP. They're the real heroes (stupid meme...). 'Cause, at the end of the day, someone, somewhere, knows what was done to change their game.  If the Xbox One had patch notes, ala PlayStation 4, that would help tremendously.

Let's go with the 44 pixel high sample, since it gives us more to work with. From what I understand, , then I take the samples divided by the height, which gives 0.6363636363636364. Using this new number, I then multiply it by what? This where I get super confused. I fathom I use that number to then multiply different resolution numbers until it comes out to something. What resolution number do I use? Horizontal or vertical?  In my 44 pixel high count I got 28 samples across. Do I then use a horizontal resolution number to determine the count, ie 1920? I keep getting weird numbers no matter what I punch in, which tells me I am clearly doing something wrong.   What isn't looking good? A resolution increase? If that's what you're looking for, then, yeah, it sounds like you're gonna be disappointed. The facts are (thus far), however, that the game is getting an enhancement in the realm of a higher frame rate. That's still an enhancement.  Hopefully we'll get more information, since the game comes out in 2 days, but WCCF Tech has proven to be a reliable resource during my experience curating the OP."

Gestault,2019-01-19 15:28:27,0.918,quote,Positive,"I don't agree with their conclusions that this amounts to ruining the underlying game experience, but it's a reasonable frustration when dramatically more powerful hardware sees no benefit in a situation where CPU elements are already accounted for in the ""budget"" (which allows the baseline 60 fps target) and remaining rendering capability appears unused.  As I said previously, if people think of this as a situation where the devs only included the equivalent to a performance mode (because they believe the 60 fps target is central to the game design), it comes across as better. That's how I think about it, and I like it that way. That being said, there's no worldly reason for the results we're seeing where even huds aren't made for full resolution, let alone effectively no rendering differences between vastly different hardware. The work already put into the PC version, UE4 as the engine, and the similar architecture between the Pro and 1X would normally present more opportunities for a more powerful platform. Having does go against basically every expectation hobbyists would expect."

But still, AAA games at 1080p with  60fps is rare on both Pro and X, the most common scenario is that they’re  60fps, so I’m just thinking that it’s exaggerated to essentially boycot Namco for the rare performance issues seen here."

Their reply was that it ""isn't enhanced for either PS4 Pro or Xbox One X and on both consoles it has the same resolution"" (but they didn't specify that resolution). I don't understand why they wouldn't advertise 2160p if it runs at that on the X - but I'm happy to hear that it does. Definitely makes it more likely I'll buy it on Xbox now, as I don't think my PC would run it too well."
DJ Lushious,2019-01-23 11:44:25,0.2129,quote,Positive,"Sadly RE2 is not alone in its wonky HDR implementation. Red Dead Redemption 2 and Nier are 2 that immediately come to mind as also being disingenious.  I've taken the stance that if the title sends the TV an HDR10 signal, then it gets listed, regardless of the quality of the implementation. Details are practically non-existent on titles where HDR10 is implemented; only when the results are broken, so that's my reasoning. However, if it's something that  Dolby Atmos is reason enough to justify the purchase, for me. And considering one of the enemy types in RE2, I could see the overheads getting some love (if Capcom manages to do this right).   I've not played every Atmos title, but Shadow of the Tomb Raider is one I played that uses the soundscape to full effect. Music, ambient sounds, and primary sounds are fed to the overhead. It's my Atmos reference game, of the few I have played; it truly showcases how much more immersive of an experience Atmos brings to the gaming world.  Strange, indeed. Last April the studio was at C2E2 and I asked them if the game was to get X support and the person manning the booth said it already did. I'll eat my hat, if I'm wrong, but it would take a blind person to not recognize that it's running at a very high resolution. If you buy it please come and report your findings. Nonetheless, it's a fun title easily worth $20."

Adaptive vsync works by enabling screen tearing when the game drops below the target framerate, but being tear free as long as the game is running at or above the target framerate. It has the benefit of keeping tearing at the top of the screen where it is less noticeable and of slightly reducing image lag (because you aren't buffering a frame until the next display refresh as you do with triple buffer vsync).  Unlocked framerate in console gaming,  refers to either a triple buffered vsync game or one that has vsync disabled."

But it is normal to branch into another development path for the demo while optimization for the main game is ongoing. I would assume the demo is between 1-2 months behind regarding console-side code optimizations. I am certainly not talking about server-side optimizations because that was their whole reason to release a public beta. And it showed that they were not ready the first time. Both beta phases should had helped them to find the most annoying bugs in their net code.

Main reason is that I have a 7.2.2 ATMOS set up and I really love how good it sounds, especially games that support ATMOS. Since the Samsung's do not support eARC, I cannot get ATMOS and also VRR/Freesync. Last night I switched to VRR/Freesync and tested Tomb Raider like MosquitoSmasher has already mentioned, that hub area is butter smooth versus the framey/screen tearing it was without Freesync. You also get the benefit of even better input lag.  I am sending the audio to my receiver and it sounds good still, but no where near as good as when running in Atmos. One of the reasons I am now thinking of getting a LG 2019 set is that they have VRR/Freesync and support eArc. So I could direct connect the Xbox One X to the LG (no receiver exists that passes VRR/Freesync) and let the TV pass through the Atmos signal to the receiver and be able to enjoy VRR/Freesync and ATMOS. I still need to see reviews for the LG2019 sets first since I am concerned about NITS and the ABL. I had a 2017 E7 OLED and loved it but the HDR brightness was not as good as I wanted and when using my PC and reading forums with white backgrounds the ABL would kick in and dim the screen. I already heard that the ABL is a bit less aggressive and the NITS is a bit better, but still will wait for reviews."

Whenever I feel my Vizio P65-C1 has had its run I am certain I'll replace it with an OLED. Though I never had burn-in when I owned a Pioneer Pro-101fd, it's been so nice to not even have a thought of that with my LCD panel. I'll want a burn-in warranty as a safety net and for peace of mind. Also, it's comforting to know Best Buy isn't sticking it to you on the replacement credit.   Can you elaborate on that further? I set my Xbox to ""Atmos"" only when I know I am going to play an Atmos title; 7.1 (and lower) feeds stay wrapped within an Atmos container with the Xbox Atmos setting, which prevents my AVR from upmixing those signals to use my overhead speakers (which, hey, I've got 'em, so I wanna us 'em!). Unless something has changed recently...  Yes, yes you do. Temper expectations, though, especially in the video game space (movies, too, actually). What little I've tested on FFXV and Gears of War 4, the overhead channels only get love when there is something overhead. Whereas, for example, Shadow of the Tomb Raider uses the overhead channels for music, ambient sounds, and sounds from above. It's my reference Atmos game. I'm anxious to see if Crackdown 3 is going to be a stellar Atmos title.    I've steered clear of Judgment since briefly playing it at PAX one year. However, I'd give it a concerted effort if it got the 2160p treatment."

I've been doing some digging, but that metric is going to be hard to determine, since there have been X updates for titles that were released before the system was released (The Master Chief Collection, for example).  Going by Wikipedia's """" entry, there are 1,907 titles released for the Xbox One (across all regions). There are 364 Xbox One titles in the OP. 272 of them feature ""2160"" in their entry*. Ignoring a small margin of error for a whole myriad of different reasons, here's some fun statistics based on those numbers.  19.09% of all Xbox One titles feature an X Enhancement of some kind. 14.26% of all Xbox One titles are 4K, including dynamic rendering. 74.73% of all Xbox One titles in the OP are 4K, including dynamic rendering.  * My search grabbed titles like Attack on Titan 2, Quantum Break, and Unravel 2, which all are rendered below 2160p but have some element to them that is in 2160p (like Unravel 2's lighting is rendered in 2160p).  I don't know the answer to that, but it's in Microsoft's official Xbox One X Enhanced list. Yesterday I took some time and compared their list against mine and updated the OP with any differences. Microsoft's list isn't the Bible, as I've seen errors/omissions in there in the past, so it could definitely be wrong. However, looking at the Microsoft Store entry, it doesn't list ""X Enhanced"" and I've found that to be a more accurate record than Microsoft's list.

wafflebrain,2019-03-23 21:25:42,0.2951,No quote,Positive,Picked up Witcher 3 Complete Edition ($15 is a steal seriously) on the sale and really impressed how well the game cleans up and runs on the X in both performance and 4k modes. One thing that's odd though is it seems the slider keeps defaulting to the 4k side after setting it to performance in settings. Probably a bug :shrugs  Game still holds up remarkably well visually for a 2015 title. Not like that's surprising given CDProjekt and all. The vegetation art team alone deserves an award.

It drives me batty when we get these titles that mimic the lowest common denominator, but, hey, welcome to consoles (and I say that with love). Maybe Rage 2 is a game that truly needs to be played at 60fps, but I would have much rather had options to choose from.  Oh, jeez, I have no idea how to efficiently gather that data. And would we consider games with single player campaigns, but also feature multiplayer modes?  Here's some food for thought, though.

Weird since the first Darksiders Enhancement was 60fps so it's a bit disappointing in that regard but it does run better than the non patched 1080p/30fps version and the sharpness really cleans up all the ultra jaggies in the areas where there's a bunch of foliage.

Screen-tearing is the biggest offender for me and it drives me crazy, so I can confidently say it is not in the X1X version.  Now Darksiders 2  drop frame rate at times, but it's not often. One time I had it drop into the teens (my guess) and it made no sense where I was at in the game, but once I closed an app that was asleep the game returned to normal. So, keep that in mind.  All in all, I am really impressed how clean the game looks and the art style never gets old. Yeah, I'd rather it be 4K/60fps like Darksiders 1 is (made even more jarring that I played through Darksiders 1 again before jumping to 2), but I am enjoying myself nonetheless,   Thanks for the heads-up!

It just seems like someone should have looked at this, and the other games you listed and said, ""Hey, this isn't good enough, let's work on this."" As far as I know, there's no mandate for these patches, so why put them out in a half-baked state?"

Xbox One X in Graphic Fidelity Mode renders at a native resolution of approximately 1955x1100 and uses a temporal reconstruction technique that can increase the pixel count up to 3200x1800.

A lot of developers talk of 4K ""support"" in generic terms, and don't always mean native 4K.  . Problem is I have the game on both platforms, and I can say with certainty the Pro version looks less sharp than the XB1X version. So I think they're just generically calling higher resolutions ""4K' here, and I'm not convinced the X is native 4K either. My guess is the Pro is at 1440p, and the X is at 1800p, but admittedly that's just my rough guess based on seeing these resolutions in other games."

For now, the only information I have available is what the dev says.  This has forever been the challenge of curating a list like this. Information is not always available, is muddied, or changes over time. As such, there's going to be an inherent margin of error in my list.  Wowzers, that is a pretty game!

For titles like this, some times the best I can find is what the Microsoft Store lists and what developers have said.  Candleman, for example, is listed as 4K on the Microsoft Store and interviews with the . X Enhanced doesn't always necessarily mean a resolution bump. Is it possible Candleman has an increased framerate over the base or extra graphical effects, but remains 1080p?  Is Sword Art Online also a potential candidate where there is no resolution increase, but graphical effects, instead?  I'm not opposed to removing a title from the list, but I just want to cover all bases first."

Candleman is an unusual case since it's been 2 years from that interview and it still hasn't been X Enhanced. I'd be curious to know if they enhanced the PS4 Pro version and not the X which would be kind of messed up.  Anyway, Sword Art is the same as I haven't seen anything enhanced and it actuality feels badly optimized. Usually X enhanced games have some sort of visual giveaway but I think both of these may have just be mislabeled, probably to get people to buy the game lol. But yeah I'd say remove those from the list just for accuracy's sake."

Murdy Plops,2020-01-20 03:55:37,0.6125,No quote,Positive,I'm surprised at the negative takes on Rage 2. Admittedly; I was a fan of the original but I think it was a natural evolution of the first in the right places?  The only thing I'm not a fan of (after playing 15 hours or so) is the DLC that's advertised and ONLY purchasable via fictitious-Rage2 branded currency! That shit should be flat out illegal. Having to look at 'exchange rates' for a game is some serious BS that should have been left on the cutting room floor. If I want to buy your expansion let me just pay the fee in my native currency without having to worry about leaving £ spare after the purchase.   I like the game though :)
terminaljeremy,2020-01-20 04:18:55,-0.8478,No quote,Negative,"LTTP: Metro Exodus is really good so far. I think like a lot of games that came out last year (or maybe the end of 2018?) it got a tiny bit of negative reaction and the narrative was that it was not that great so everyone stayed away. And after a thousand thread posts about how terrible it is to have an open world and no-one wanted Metro to leave the... metro... all I can say is, well I'm glad they did. The main missions so far (I think I'm about halfway? I'm in the Caspian desert) have been great and really varied, and the stealth has been quality. The scarcity of ammo and supplies is just right, you only occasionally feel well-equipped and it's usually about 20 seconds before you get your arse handed to you. So it's still super-tense and full of the usual Metro-flavour survival horror stealth. If you were on the fence about it I'd say give it a go."
King Dazzar,2020-01-20 06:25:04,0.5023,quote,Positive,I bought it on release and it was a bug ridden and unstable experience on the x1x.

gar3,2020-02-03 07:34:16,0.5994,quote,Positive,"I believe the current blurb about  is incorrect: The game  feature HDR. The confusion came about because the developer, Monomi Park, stated in a press release after an update that it hoped to bring HDR to Xbox One X in a future patch... but that hasn't happened yet. Even Microsoft's list shows no HDR for X enhancements. I can confirm 2160p, improved overall graphics quality, water shader rendering, and texture detail but the game is nowhere near a steady 60fps at any time ever. In the menu options a player can toggle ""Enable Vsync"" but I'm unsure what it is locking it at. Without that enabled the game surely features an unlocked framerate which is more preferable in my opinion. So, I propose to change  to the following: "

But its a superb port so far and was expecting a lot more issues. Pleasantly surprised. Definitely 60fps with no dips. Difficult to say on res as its quite soft with the AA, but its certainly what looks like a 4k ui and I'd say a minimum of 1800p map/units.  I prefer this version over the PC due to how well it plays with a controller and its ui is better at 4k than on the pc due to font size. Good stuff. I'll post again if I encounter any issues as I know Civ can slow down late game, but so far I'm half way through with the map nearly fully revealed. Thumbs up from moi.

And for a long overdue ""State of the Union"".*   I have recorded 542 Xbox One X Enhanced titles, with 438, or 81%, of them featuring the term ""2160p.""   40 of those titles use dynamic rendering techniques to get there. That brings down the native 4K titles to 398, or 73%, of all X Enhanced titles.  It has been 842 days since the Xbox One X was released on November 07, 2017. That equates to an average of 0.64 X Enhanced titles released per day and 4.41 titles per week.  * Please don't take these numbers as verse.

I found the visuals quite nice in the footage last year. So it doesn't look anywhere close to PC on X then? Dips below 30fps even after that delay is rather.....let's just say it's quite sad."
W.S.,2020-02-18 14:13:47,0.9337,quote,Positive,"Yeah despite the somewhat soft image quality Call of Cthulu is definitely enhanced given that there aren't a ton of jaggies. There's film grain in it though which does mess with the image quality, not sure if it's toggable or not since I didn't mess around with the settings. The framerate seems like it might be unlocked however since it's pretty much all over the place.  Darksiders Genesis looks pretty decent to me, it has a high resolution and the framerate is at least from what small amount I've played. My only issue is that the camera is so panned out that you lose a lot of detail in the character models (if any) and it sucks that you can't zoom into the environment more.  Also as a sidenote to these games:    I MAY have to walk back on this one not being enhanced. I can't quite put my finger on it but despite some weird stuff going on with the outline of the cel shaded characters having jaggies it kind of looks like it's either:  A) Enhanced to be 1080p with extra settings  or  B) Be above 1080p but with post processing affecting the anti aliasing  Again it doesn't run all that great but I think there may be more to this one than I thought since there are a bunch of spots in the game that look much better than the intro training level.    Learned about this in the PS4 Pro Enhancement thread but this game does have a toggle for a higher framerate/resolution so apologies for this one. I just assumed it was going to have the higher resolution settings off the bat."

From what I can see, I'd believe that  is 2160t--that is, temporally reconstructed 4K. It does seem to be variable, but it's very difficult to determine the base resolution (which suggests considerable upscaling, if I'm correct about the TAA). If I had to put numbers to it, I counted base elements that seem to range from 1080p to 1620p. In any case, though the geometry is often countable as full 2160p, the textures are never filtered to that degree.  Take all that analysis as tentative; the best I can do, but not necessarily correct."

DJ Lushious,2020-10-19 12:01:52,0.9838,quote,Positive,"Guess which thread is ready to usher in a new console generation?!  I've still a lot of work to do, but I wanted to share how I am retrofitting Series X|S data so far and leave it open to feedback. After all, this thread is nothing without all of you, my fellow Era users.  Anything that is indented is specific to the system category it belongs to, otherwise the setting is shared across all devices (such as Dolby Atmos or HDR).  On the topic of HDR, I've tried to make it easier to identify which titles feature it at a glance by coloring it. With Auto-HDR being a thing, it would be awfully redundant to list it for every title. So, in this new world, it's there to indicate native HDR implementation.  Going with the standard format currently in place, I only list what's different over the base console. Let's highlight Fallout 4, from the below. On the One S and One X it runs at 30fps; there's no difference in the framerate, so it's not listed. For the Series X|S entries, the framerate is doubled, so it's listed.  One X = One S baseline, Series S = One S baseline, and Series X = One X baseline. Assuming Fallout 4 runs at 1080p on the Series S, only its framerate changes. Same with the Series X. So, with the current formatting logic I wouldn't list the resolution.   Here's where I start getting knotted up. I'm on the fence of listing the resolution of an S|X Enhanced title, even if it remains the same as the base Xbox's. And, since the Series X will always share the One X's enhancements, do I list the enhancements a second time? For example, would ""enhanced god rays and draw distance"" and 2160p  be listed under both One X and Series X?  I could definitely use a second opinion on this one.                   I had asked this in the Black Ops Beta thread, but never received an answer. I could have swore I was getting discrete effects across my 4 ceiling speakers on Thursday, but when playing a few matches over the weekend it didn't seem like they were getting anything other than upmixed sound.  Where did you find that it's in Atmos?  I do hope it is! And I do hope that with the new Series consoles that Atmos is native to every title. I wonder if Dolby Vision is going to be on a per-title basis, too."
Liabe Brave,2020-10-19 13:41:44,0.9407,quote,Positive,"If you post 4K shots, I'd be happy to take a look at them.  It'd probably be helpful to also tag the titles that  have auto-HDR. Users will likely want to know this, and hopefully it'll be very few to keep up with.  To retain most of your current format while reducing repetition, you might try the below. Each subhead only lists changes from the one beneath it. (With One S assumed as the baseline.)       This is less text, but personally I find it a little hard to follow. My own solution would be to give in to the urge to include every bit of info on every line. In addition I'd add One S, so the baseline is explicit. This also solves the issue of naturally wanting to put Series S and Series X adjacent, even though Series X will often have more in common with One S than One X.         This is the approach I've taken in my Pro thread, and this part of the formatting seems to be clear to most folks. But you should follow what's most requested from users of this thread, as well as what suits your own needs."

It might be worth asking how people use it too. i.e. do they primarily pick a game and then see what modes it has OR do they pick a mode, and then want a list of games that has the mode.  Short term, while Series S|X launches, they may want the latter to try out features like auto hdr. Longer term they may care more about looking up a specific game for a purchasing/playing choice?"

Yeah, my intention was to mark those titles somehow they also happen to be an Enhanced titles. Throughout my time I've ran into Xbox One titles that have HDR, but don't have any X Enhancements, so they didn't fit under the goal of the OP. However, it certainly makes sense to start logging that, with the evolution of the OP.  I agree that the above looks off. I tried playing around with the ""Enhanced god..."" line and the best I could find that was visually clear was with repetition. I've always tried to keep in mind my character limits per post, but I think it's time to do away with that notion.  RE:  I'd have to go through ~715 entries and find each one's One S technical information; not that I am above doing so, but I've firmly stuck to the notion of recording only what's different. Which is why the Fallout 4 example has been bouncing around in my head a lot.  I think it's a good compromise, while still keeping in the spirit of the OP (and my sanity), to list both a Series S' resolution and framerate, even if only one of those gets an update.  For example, here's how Borderlands 3's entry will look (I'm making an assumption on the Series S):          That was one I did I double-take when it came out, as I couldn't find any X enhancements (while its predecessor does). I've been looking at DF's channel watching the latest videos to drop, but missed the one on Project Cars 3. Thanks  much for catching that!  RE:  I wouldn't doubt it, even if that notion is firmly in the ""conspiracy theory"" realm. I'll certainly be adding the Atmos badge to Black Ops' entry.  Have I mentioned that I am simply  that we should be getting a lot more object-oriented sound-based titles with the incoming generation? A lot of emphasis is put on visuals, and rightfully so, but sound is just as important to the experience.  All entries will be in the same format as my Borderlands 3 example above. I'm not straying too far from the general framework that currently exists in the OP.  Something like Auto-HDR, which gets applied to all titles, would be awfully redundant to list. So, like how Xbox 360 and Xbox OG titles get automatic 16x AF on the One X, I'll list in the initial OP's blurb what ""generic"" additions the Series consoles bring.  is handling the Xbox Series X's OT.

That's wishful thinking, but there is still much we don't know about how the Series S will handle existing games.   store entry.

I know Series X games need to be installed on the ssd. Will it just run the One X version or will it not work and prompt you to put it on the internal storage?  With Halo MCC collection for example I'd rather just run the unenhanced version from a USB drive to save space on the ssd.  Similarly, If I have a game like Gears 5 on an external USB and transfer it over to the ssd will it just update it to the Series x enhanced version or will I have to delete and download the whole thing again?  Neither are major issues but it does have me curious."

As to what happens if you stop that auto-update? Great question! I don't think that's been communicated yet. However, going by how the One X doesn't have an Xbox One version of the game unto itself (like how the Series have their own version), hopefully it would run the game at its One X enhanced level.   I could be very wrong in that we don't know yet, but we do know One X|S titles don't have to reside on the internal/expansion drive to run. So, if you can stop the auto-update and simply run the One X enhanced code, in the scenario above, then cold storage would be fine.   You are a !  Going back to the above, Gears 5 would auto-update; you won't have to re-download the whole game. It remains to be seen how big these Smart Delivery patches, for lack of a better word, will be."

I couldn't find anything definitive.                 Thanks, I don't know how I missed that!  Assuredly both modes can't be the same. Maybe there's graphical effect differences between the 2? The increased texture detail and effects, can you or anyone confirm they remain the same across both modes?  I don't own Borderlands 3 and my internet sleuthing is coming up empty on the differences.   Halo's doesn't come out until November 17. When this was just the One X Enhanced thread, I would post game details upon release. However, with the addition of the Series X|S I've decided to post what's known. Since we all our excited with our new systems, it made sense to me to have the information available for reference in anticipation of release and not just on release.  My fellow posters: do you think having an indicator that the listing is for the future would be helpful?   Halo's patch hits November 17.  I can't find any information on Rainbox Six Siege.  seems to imply the patch would be available on console drop. Maybe today, with the PlayStation 5 release it'll hit?   If you, or anyone else, sees their game update, please let me know!  It's a thing of beauty, isn't it? I fired up The Council last night, just because its performance was rough even on the One X and was  surprised to see the game's framerate is unlocked. Well, outside of cutscenes and dialog screens, which are all locked to 30fps (and make up most of that game). But still...  I missed the news that the broken X Enhanced patch got fixed. I'm correcting that now."

This gen Microsoft still continues this way of dynamic, smart delivered, patches on the same SKU while this is complete chaos on PS5 with back compatibility games only being allowed to get ""soft"" patches with stuff the PS4 could theoretically also do and if not you have to create a single PS5 SKU version of the game, which doesn't seem to be that simple when I look at comments from as example the Rocket League team which simply said, ""sorry, can't give you 120fps cause we need to do a PS5 SKU for that and we can't do that easily"".  So when it comes to multi platform games, it could happen that some developers maybe say ""nope, not worth our time to only make it for one console"".  I know this also happened here and there on last Gen, but this is never something that makes everyone happy and specially in a brand new gen you will avoid this console war stuff."

A random search found that Breakdown nor Unreal Championship 2 were on the store, though.   I think it's fair to say that The Witcher 3 tops off at 1440p, just the One X never could quite there reliably enough. 1332p, which I took from Digital Foundry's analysis, is an odd top-end resolution. I'll do some more digging around and see if anyone ever caught what resolution Performance Mode uses.    There's an ""*"" in there.

I think it's because it's a fairly small jump. 1080p to 1440p, and the 60 fps makes it look extra crispy, even at the lower resolution. Also, the HDR does a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to making the game look good. And of course the pretty stuttery performance in resolution mode doesn't help things."

At least then it would eliminate any residue state of the game and or console.  After that I would be wondering if its anything to do with a previous profile/save state of the game i.e ensure you have cleared any profile save data for it. Perhaps ensure your console is set as home console too.  Hope that helps. I may just download it and see if it works my end too.  EDIT: ok I've just booted it and its fine my end.

Goldenroad,2020-12-08 09:22:48,0.9898,No quote,Positive,"I started playing Gears Tactics a couple days ago, and if I'm being honest, if this is one of MS's first party's optimizing their game for Series X, I'm not very blown away, and may even be a little worried. It runs, mostly, pretty smooth, but I have had a couple glitches where I have had to restart from a checkpoint, and I also feel like, when enemies are coming in from off screen that the frame rate looks like it takes a hit. The problem for me though, is the load times. They aren't horrendous, probably 10-15 seconds (I didn't actually count) to get into a given mission, but that still seems like too much based on what I'm hearing about games like Miles Morales on PS5, and the fact that you need to load into a mission every time you want to start a mission. I want to chalk it up to, ""well, it wasn't built from the ground up for Series X"", but you could say the same thing about Miles. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, and I'm sure the load times on XB1 must be much longer, but it just feels like, for this type of game, from a MS first party, on this hardware, I shouldn't have to deal with loading screens for every mission.  All that said, given the length of these missions and the nature of the gameplay, this is a great Quick Resume game. I didn't realize how long the last mission I started last night was going to take, and I didn't want to risk exiting out and losing progress, even though I really needed to go to bed, but then I remembered ""screw it, just back out to the home screen, and even if I start up another game tomorrow and forget about Gears Tactics for a week I'll be able to hit resume and be right back on the same turn I was on."""

Then it got a patch that made performance with RT on terrible, and introduced crashing with RT on and the game also randomly locks to 30FPS until you restart the game sometimes. Two patches since and the crashing is fixed but the performance isn’t and neither is the 30FPS bug. Now in today’s patch the HDR has been seemingly broken with raised blacks, so everything that was black is now grey. AFAIK this was always a problem in the menus but it was fine in gameplay, now the game looks terrible on an OLED. I was halfway through the campaign when the patch came out that broke RT and I just want to finish the game. Is there a single release from the end of this year that isn’t broken in some way? Honest question. Feel like every game I’ve bought for my Series X I’m just waiting for patches to fix except for Yakuza.

Gamer @ Heart,2020-12-17 04:17:05,0.775,quote,Positive,"Upgrade is generous term. All they have said is they are uncapping the frame rate from 30. Nothing about changing sliders to make it a closer match the PC version sadly. The game is a stunner, but by the time that upgrade cones out the game will be in maintenance mode. It's unlikely it gets meaningful support after the end of this season. Especially with those player numbers."

Couldn't find anything in the in-game options.   That's the worst issue with the Series S. And it's not even a problem with the hardware itself; it's got the corpse of the original Xbox One tied around its neck.   Hopefully Microsoft can find a way of addressing that without too much of a hassle.

Chip Chanceworth,2021-01-03 17:12:18,0.329,quote,Positive," Why do you think this is? Did the game run at an unlocked frame rate originally? Seems like a crazy boost that no game has really gotten. Well I guess Sekiro has, but that game floated around 45 on the 1x. So it was inevitable."
W.S.,2021-01-03 20:19:32,-0.8936,quote,Negative,"I think they were both targeting 60fps but fell short.  The devs might have known it would get boosted on future hardware through BC & left it that way but either way it worked out really well given how great they look now. Terminator Resistance got a big boost the same way although that one does specify having an ""unlimited framerate"" and it runs at 60fps now. Code Vein, Agents of Mayhem (although still a bit stuttery), Steel Rats, City of Brass, Submerged, Shaq Fu, State of Mind, DOA 6, Meow Motors, Dirt Rally 2.0 are also worth checking out now through BC since they run dramatically different. Dirt Rally 2.0 in particular had the screen tearing fixed through BC & resolution mode runs at 60fps throughout so it looks pristine in that mode now.  BTW looking back on the Resident Evil 3 remake, I'm actually bit annoyed at Capcom's solution for fixing the framerate. John at Digital Foundry suggested a 30fps toggle so that there would be a choice to run it at two different settings (30fps capped or target 60fps) but Capcom just lowered the checkerboarding resolution and called it a day. While it fixed the framerate on the One X, the Series X would have just powered through that and kept the higher checkerboarded resolution.  It's locked at 30fps on One X/Series X."

I noticed when playing RE3 that the game went from running at a locked 60 at launch, to running with framerate drops like it does on Xbox One X after the firmware update last month. Bizarrely, changing the refresh rate of the console to 60 and back to 120 again (or just leaving at 60) completely fixes the issue - back to a locked 60 again throughout.. until the next time you put the console in to suspend at least.  It can't just be RE3 with this issue. Of course if I leave the console at 60hz output then this issue will never manifest itself but I do like the 120hz output due to latency and for games like Rocket League that support it."

Even if they officially double the frame rate, you're still going to have to use mods to reduce frame drops unless they also change the graphical settings.

Anything 4K I shrunk down to 1440p just because the files are so huge, but otherwise, these should be basically lossless PNGs. Oddly enough, vertical walls always seemed to have high filtering regardless of the game, even when ground textures seemed to be lower.  Oblivion definitely looks like lower AF (possibly the original setting?) when running at 4K, at least from what I saw when I checked. Auto HDR seemed to interact with the bloom a bit to exaggerate that loss of detail on bright ground surfaces, too:  Gears 3 at 4K looks plausibly (?) like 8-16X AF when running at 4K:  Lost Odyssey is harder for me to tell between the low base resolution and heavy DoF blur effect, but I'm wondering if this is the original filtering setting: "

From your screen shot I’d say LO is definitely benefiting from the texture filtering judging from the pattern on the floor. That game has a terribly heavy DoF effect from memory and is also 720p, so it won’t look as sharp as other games.   I also did my own test for Gears 3 a few minutes ago and the textures appear crisp at even the sharpest angles on Series X (tested the first area in chapter 3 or 4 with the ash statues). Oblivion should be the easiest to test though thanks to the FPS view and landscape."

However, if you turn off the 4k boost and play it at 720p it appears to benefit from it.

So I ran around an early stress test point (first apartment you explore with the table on the roof down) and I tried it with a combination of 4k, Ray tracing, and dynamic resolution. 4k dynamic is rock solid and ray tracing 4k dynamic only has very minor stutters.   I then ran around the first hour or so trying out the different settings and did find a few spots where 4k dynamic with ray tracing dropped slightly (I’d guess mid 50’s).  I then finished the game with 4k dynamic resolution and ray tracing off and it was almost completely locked (although at points I enabled VRR on my TV).   It still stutters for a split second when saving or when streaming in a new area, but even this is seriously reduced after the new patch.   So dynamic 4k is as solid as pretty much any 60FPS game this gen. And pre-patch it felt like it never ran above 50FPS.   The HDR is demo worthy as well."

Basically 99% of XSX games support VRR, regardless of the flag on the store, and for those rarities like CotS that don't support VRR it's likely a mistake or is running on an ancient engine that doesn't play nicely with it.

Having at least ""60fps"" helps, so thanks for sharing that!  Before the Series X|S launched, I organized the OP to list the frame rate only if it was different from the base game. With the Series X|S, I've deviated from that and do list the frame rate. With 951 titles in the OP, however, it would be a monumental task to retroactively identify every entry's frame rate. If this is the way the community would like for the OP to go, I'm cool with that, since this is everyone's thread, but I would unabashedly ask for help in gathering that information.  This is one that I've never been able to get a clear answer on. For One X titles VRR was featured only if programmed explicitly for the title. And by some accounts, certain Series X|S titles don't feature VRR, which leads me to believe the same. Then someone like Digital Foundry comes along and says, for example,  and  have VRR, yet it is not communicated on the Xbox Store (which has been especially good for this information). As such, I've operated under the logic of Series X|S titles act like One X and must be programmed for VRR, since there's more examples supporting that than otherwise.   In reality, though?    Oh, what I wouldn't do for every Dev to be this open about the technical details of next-gen upgrades! And this was a Live Gold title, so double ""free""! Thanks for bringing this to my attention!"

Riky,2021-05-26 02:49:10,0.0,quote,Neutral,It matches your display output to your GPU output so the judder is gone along with the tearing.

ResidentDante,2021-05-26 06:01:15,0.9101,quote,Positive,"Not stupid at all, it's a fairly new tech for console and TV owners.  You know when you have uneven framerate? Like if you spin the camera around your character and sometimes the camera moves smooth, then slower and faster and slower etc. Because the framerate is varying?  Well that's unnoticeable with VRR. Same are sudden and more typical framerate drops within the VRR window of your TV or monitor. It really is the perfect tech for most games on console as they so often never hit a perfect 60fps. It's about keeping that aim smooth even though the frames are dropping, instead of the annoying fast/slow/fast/slow messed up fluidity.  My Samsung TV has a 45-120fps range. While I also have a 60hz PC monitor that allows a 40-60fps range. This helps save games going very low, any lower than 40 and the game should be locked to 30fps anyhow."
pswii60,2021-05-26 06:10:04,0.5267,quote,Positive,Worth adding to this that VRR can go below the stated 40-45 by using LFC (low framerate compensation). It's done on the GPU side by simply doubling frames. That's how Watch Dogs Legion supports VRR on XSX despite being a 30fps game.
eso76,2021-05-26 06:19:05,-0.296,quote,Negative,"Let's say a 60hz TV refreshes the image every 60th of a second. The moment the console is late feeding the tv the new frame, you will either have tearing or the previous image will stay on screen for 2 frames, essentially immediately dropping framerate to 30fps. On a normal 60hz set you can't have a consistent 40, 45 or 48fps, it's either 60 or half that ( or one third etc.). VRR means the screen refreshes whenever it receives a new frame, so when framerate drops below 60 the screen will be able to display, let's say, 58 or 55 or 50. Basically making the occasional framedrops unnoticeable. No more judder"
ResidentDante,2021-05-26 06:22:24,0.0,quote,Neutral,Is this because XB1 and SeriesX/S family sends double frames to the TV for 30fps games? So a VRR window of 40-60 can be 20-30 on a 30fps game?
Adryuu,2021-05-26 06:52:07,0.7516,quote,Positive,"30 fps games on console send duplicate frames (the same frame twice, always, in the best case scenario) to tvs on a 60hz mode, yes, basically, when all works well.  With VRR though, the console only sends the frames as they are produced, and the tv just doesn't update the image at a constant rate, hence the name for variable refresh rate. It only updates the image when it receives a new frame, eliminating torn frames and reducing or eliminating the judder feeling. When framerate is really bad though you should still notice a slideshow effect. But VRR is aimed at higher framerates (not for games at 25-30 fps, more for 60+ fps) so it shouldn't hurt that much."

While I have a solid steam library of 800+ games since I have started home working I moved significantly to console gaming and the few things I play on PC still (mostly Total War, Paradox & other strategy games) aren’t optimal on controllers - I have a steam controller already and despite liking it I still have never got past how cumbersome mouse and keyboard driven games like these feel."

That's not to say the Series S isn't an excellent deal for the cost, but so is the Deck, considering what you're able to do with it. You can say the Series S will run games better than the Deck, yeah. But only at home. When on the go, it's very difficult to compare the Series S vs the Deck unless you consider what the actual user experience is.  Considering the Switch OLED or even regular Switch, the Series S also runs around that and is cheaper, too. And yet, they aren't really comparable devices unless you intend to use the Switch with a TV. Same deal with the Deck.  I just don't think your comparison holds much water honestly. Not unless there's another device similar to the Deck in specs for a similar price, which there really isn't (yet). Obviously that won't be true forever. This opens the floodgates, and SteamOS 3.0 is probably the bigger deal here for manufacturers."

Valve is a small player in electronics manufacturing so they pay more per unit for components, shipping, manufacturing, etc. Not to mention the handheld has a LCD, a battery, a gyro, etc. It also is going to cost more per unit for the R&D because Valve doesn't anticipate sales near the level of the Series S."

Pargon,2021-07-15 16:07:51,-0.1779,quote,Negative,"When IGN asked Valve if they could use Game Pass on it, the answer was basically: ""It's a PC, you can run whatever you want on it."" I expect that means you will have to install Windows on it yourself, rather than using SteamOS 3, if you want to play Game Pass games. That is going to move it firmly into the ""handheld PC"" market - and everything that entails - rather than ""handheld Steam device"" with a custom-tailored operating system/user interface.  Compare it to the Switch, not an Xbox. Your comparison is ridiculous. For $50 more than the Switch OLED, you get roughly 4x the performance in a similar form-factor, no walled garden, and far less expensive games."

I believe the size is more related to the layout of the controls they went with and ergonomics. Flared control handles and full sized analog sticks probably dictated size more than the internal fan.

It does look silly though. A bit too wide. Like the Switch is wide, but this is wiiiide. Also those controls look weirdly placed but maybe they're fine.  Before seeing the video for it I was sure it was just gonna be some streaming only display that still required a base PC running the server. Surprised to see that it's actually a computer.

Including the two TouchPads on top of two analog sticks, a dpad, face buttons, and four paddle buttons and a touch screen? is a brilliant move.  This seems way more appealing to me than a switch, just due to the fact that it will already play the over 1000 games and apps in my steam library (and all my music and soundtracks?). Plus, this thing will have tons of apps right out of the gate. If it can play Netflix, and all the streaming apps through a web browser, let me read my humble bundle comics, and even use the touch screen to do simple drawings or maybe even some pixel art, this thing will be basically everything I'd ever want out of a handg Handheld or a tablet.  Also, I'm really curious what cpu and gpu equivalent it has under its hood. It kind of seems better than a Ryzen 3200G, and must be using GDDR5 or GDDR6 for ram (8, 10 or 12GB?).

Green,2021-07-15 16:13:47,0.9926,quote,Positive,"I think it does. Comparing manufacturing costs, Microsoft takes a loss on Series S, so you need to consider that, too. Valve likely is not taking a loss.  As a consumer, however, you can't really compare what it might cost for a manufacturer to add these extras to a Series S and then compare it in like kind.  As for extra hardware compared to a Series S, the Deck has: 800p LCD battery touch digitizer haptic rumble touch sensitive thumbsticks haptic trackpads stereo speakers 4 back paddles microphone array Gyro sensor Bluetooth 5.0 with audio support microSD expansion slot  Now I'm not saying that all adds up to $230 manufacturing costs compared to a Series S. But it is probably pretty close, and certainly not attainable as a consumer buying a Series S looking for an equivalent experience that the Deck provides (on the go at least). You'd be cutting it pretty close - and some of those things are obviously not possible or even relevant on the Series S.  Also, if your intent is to primarily play the Deck at home, you'd also need the Dock, which would add to the cost even more. So as a console, Series S is a better purchase for sure. But as a handheld, which is obviously the primary intent of the device, I don't see where else you can get something like this backed by a big company like Valve, with decent specs and quality (which we still need to see mind you). It's really hard to match that right now. Switch and some Chinese GPD-style devices are really the only Apples-to-Apples comparison there, and this thing runs circles around those (for now).  And I'd agree with that sentiment, too. I don't think Valve are in the business of a mass-market device. Not that they'd complain if it did take off, I just don't think that's their expectation with this thing. It's a highly targeted device for a particular type of user, most likely already in the Steam ecosystem. I don't even know if they'd sell a million of these. But it's not a bad thing that it exists, for those that have been wanting it, anyway - certainly it isn't targeting people who might get a Series S instead. And the price is way better than I expected from Valve, considering their previous hardware."

Anyone expecting better price/performance from a handled PC than this has set completely unrealistic expectations.  The GPU included in this APU is better than any other integrated graphics solution on the market (RDNA2 vs. Vega and LPDDR5 vs. DDR4) , so you're going to need a dedicated GPU of some sort to beat the gaming performance of this machine.

Orayn,2021-07-15 16:45:19,0.9477,quote,Positive,"They're super flexible with how games can support them. Playing Civ, for example, you could make the left one pan the map and the right one move the cursor, independently of each other. You can also turn them into a virtual set of buttons that even includes an onscreen overlay.  It also makes them ambidextrous if you have them doing the same thing, i.e. playing FFXIV you could control the cursor while still keeping your left hand on the thumbstick, or your right hand on the face buttons."

They sounded pretty confident about this 3rd version of SteamOS's app support when they mentioned EGS as working. I don't believe for a second there'll be no issues, but the level of QA there is is up in the air.  16:10 is a interesting choice for resolution. It would be very silly to try and force older games to detect it out of the box, so I'm assuming games will actually be in 720p and the remaing 80 pixels will be used for a constant UI of some kind.  It's a comfort/strain thing. If you're playing a mouse only game, alternating between thumbs is much easier to do than constantly moving one finger back and forth."

Pargon,2021-07-15 16:59:47,0.8604,quote,Positive,"Touchpads give you far more options than analog sticks. I don't know if it would work as well on this, but with a Steam Controller I can map movement to the center of the touchpad, and the outer edge (which has a lip) to another action; e.g. dodging in that direction without having to press a button. I just extend my thumb further in that direction than usual.    When clicked, the touch-pad can mode-shift to a d-pad or bring up a radial menu for quick actions without lifting my thumb. When playing cursor-based games, sometimes I prefer to use my left thumb than my right - so I'll often assign both touchpads to mouse input. You could also assign different sensitivities to each, if you prefer. In a strategy game, you can assign the right touchpad to cursor control, and lock the left touchpad to only move along a hotbar of actions, for example. You might want to play a game with touchpad + buttons. It's faster for typing with a split keyboard.  It's just a lot more flexible."

My gpd win was like a bigger 3ds so it killed a lotta details on zoomed out games.   Just asking folks to consider every angle before wholesale thinkin every steam experience will translate flawlessly into the environment of the steam deck. Biggest issue will be read write speed of the sdcard reader as I stated before. Any games on that storage will no longer perform at full speed and will be throttled to the spec of the card reader and not run at ssd and native steam deck performances.

NaDannMaGoGo,2021-07-15 17:35:37,0.9892,No quote,Positive,"That seems like pretty nice value, actually.   It's more of a ""jack of all trades"" product, which isn't bad, though it makes it less interesting to me. Like, it's still a fairly strong PC with low power requirement, which can always have its uses. But then it wouldn't really be suited as NAS since you can't expand storage and is overkill as a pi-hole alternative. WIth a non-OLED display and only 720p, I personally also wouldn't be interested in it for video watching purposes, not over my tablet anyway.  I think its biggest strengths are all the control input and steam's fantastic customization in that regard. That does make it hella sweet for gaming and even that much more suited for emulating than it already is.  Valve is expecting it to be sold out for the next 1-2 years and I'm inclined to agree with that. Even though this product isn't in real competition with the Nintendo Switch, I can see sales slowing down should a Switch 2 with stronger and more optimized hardware, perhaps even DLSS, come out. But Steam Deck price reductions or, also pretty likely, a newer Steam Deck model might keep interest high, actually. And it wouldn't be surprising if Valve iterates on this thing somewhat quickly."

This results in the need for larger batteries, more cooling components, and more space needed to dissipate the heat from the system. Now the GPD Win 3 is tiny compared to this but Valve is also packing more components like their Haptic touchpads and it likely has a larger plastic casing to keep your hands cool from the internal thermals and it looks like it's a more ergonomic grip.  Also the switch needs to be more thicc because my hands cramp in portable mode because it's too skinny."

That this is bigger with the grips I would have had to pay extra for built into the body is great news. I expect this to be among the most comfortable handheld to hold and use over long periods for those with bigger/adult hands.  Reserving the mid-tier model tomorrow, I think."

When rumors started that Valve was doing a handheld, I was 100% in, fully expecting a home stream machine. Do i really need a competitively priced but still more expensive portable PS4 though? Honestly no, but at that price i'm fine with it. A fully open platform too, I can't complain.  This solves my biggest conundrum with how i consume games currently, when I find a great indie playable in short bursts on steam I wish for it to be on the switch, and when i find them on the switch I wish they had the pricing, features, and the free online of steam.

I really hope MS is interested in having Gamepass on it, but they'd be contributing to their own demise on the Windows side. Part of why MS is so aggressive on PC is it shores up their faded OS monopoly. Gaming is a major application category that is largely Windows exclusive. MS in a different era might have sued to stop something like Proton from shipping (they still might!).

Gamepass being added to Steam / Steam Deck extends MS's reach toward a large audience still not keen on jumping on the Gamepass wagon via their own client.

Its a list of the windows games that are supported by the OS that the SteamDeck is running on which is currently around ~75%. As far as I red Valve is planning to have 95%+ of games supported by the release of the SteamDeck.  And performance wise pretty much everything should be running buttery smooth cause the games are rendered on 720p.

If you have the know-how and the NVMe drive isn't soldered into the PCB it should be possible to replace it. I'll have to wait for a teardown video when it releases to see what the internals are like. Hopefully, it's not soldered in, uses a mainstream M.2 size, and you don't have to take apart too much to get at it.

labpleb,2021-07-15 20:40:48,0.842,No quote,Positive,I think what people don't really get about the button placement is that you will just naturally grab it up there because the back is curved to fit like a controller - it's not a flat device. The only thing that might look weird is that the sticks are slightly higher in relation to the buttons and dpad than on a ps controller but some rudimentary ergonomics tests show that for me it might actually make it a good bit more comfortable to reach the dpad which is usually quite uncomfortable for me in intense situations.

Dakkon,2021-07-15 20:55:39,0.9583,quote,Positive,"At $400 this is the best emulator handheld on the market, bar none. Everything else is either more expensive, worse specced, or both at the same time. You legitimately can't find something with a better spec:price ratio to play more modern generation emulators.  There's a ton of PC games that are great on the go, many of which are on the Switch, except now you can mod them or have far better settings. Like Stardew Valley, except with mods!  You can play Skyrim on the go, except with full mods.  This thing has TPM 2.0 so you can install Windows 11 on it when it's out and use the Android sideoading to turn this thing into a dual Windows gaming PC + mobile gaming device.  I mean, these are 4 very basic and relatively obvious use cases, I don't see what's confusing about it?"
Dreams-Visions,2021-07-15 20:56:12,0.5689,quote,Positive,"Yea it's a little bigger. Comfort with these mobile game devices ultimately depends on the size of your hands.  One thing I've never been able to do since the PSP days is play a mobile game platform for more than 30 minutes without hand discomfort because they're designed with children hands in mind most of the time. Usually this meant buying one of those cradles with a bigger hand grips to compensate. I have something like the image below strapped to my Switches...     ...otherwise the console would be almost unusuable with the thumb sticks in those positions. Pain inside of 10 minutes of play. Even with grips like this attached, it still isn't particularly comfortable for use longer than 30 minutes. It just isn't.  So for me, I have high hopes that Valve has me covered."

They also are doing large freight orders so costs of shipping are spread out through more units. Manufacturing is cheaper too for them.  Also Valve makes revenue on games bought through Steam so they can take a bit of a loss or lower revenue per unit, unlike AYA and GPD who are trying to maximize profits on each unit sold."

It's only a niche now because not very many people know things things exist and it's only very recently that they've been viable for anything beyond ancient games and Gamecube emulation.

Candescence,2021-07-15 23:57:02,0.9603,quote,Positive,"Haha, but really, the layout actually makes more sense to me now that I’ve had time to analyse the positioning of the control elements compared to the shape of the device itself - the d-pad and buttons are very close to the sticks, meaning very little thumb travel, and they're towards the edges and slightly raised above the sticks, meaning they're in a reasonably natural resting position for the thumbs as well. The trackpads aren't too bad either in terms of positioning, either, especially considering their size. I think Valve legitimately thought out the layout quite a bit in order to land on this end result.  I think the main issue for a lot of people is that, as usual, Valve isn't interested in adhering to typical controller design standards if said standards won't allow them to achieve their end goal, aka controllers designed to be able to handle PC games not otherwise suited for a controller, and that results in them throwing certain conventions out the window - for folks who have gotten used to standard controller design, this pretty much does not mesh with their perception of what controller design should be like, and will often assume it's bad design because it's not what the big 3 are doing, so it must be somehow. Not the case for everyone, but it feels like the case for a lot of these complaints as far as I’m concerned.  Granted, this is coming from someone who thinks current controller design trends need to be completely scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up. Current controllers have their roots in a form factor and layout that goes all the way back to the SNES, if not the NES, in an era where 3D gaming was a pie in the sky ambition, especially on the level of interactivity we seen in games today, and everything since has been just add-ons to that initial design, starting with the Dualshock layout. I'm not suggesting completely reinventing the wheel, but I'm sure as hell suggesting we need a new type of vehicle to be invented to use it with, in this analogy."

One of the reasons I was considering picking up a Switch OLED model was so that I could get homebrew on my launch Switch without worrying about being banned. Valve went and made a better machine for this purpose, provided everything works as intended. Hell, RPCS3 might even be playable in some instances with that CPU...  There's 100% a market for this thing specifically, especially at this price point, but it's not going to put a dent in the Switch's marketshare, and I'd call a few million units sold a massive success for this thing. It's still a PC, and in the marketing materials they use the word Linux. That will automatically scare off console crowds, and mostly for good reason if said person values something ""just working"". Things will work questionably, things will require a lot of config to get right both in and out of games (seriously why do so few games provide internal options for vsyncing at half rate). I mean, they put a 16:10 screen on the damn thing, tons of games have issues at non-16:9 resolutions. Doesn't matter how hard valve works to smooth out the issues, they're working with a compatibility layer out the gate, this will be a bad experience for someone not familiar with PC gaming.  On an oddly specific personal note, as a semi regular player of the original PSO to this day, I'm ecstatic to finally be able to play that on a quality handheld device."
CommodoreKong,2021-07-16 00:45:33,0.9477,quote,Positive,"Valve has likely committed to buying parts at a scale far beyond what any of the smaller manufacturers building similar devices can commit to buying, getting much better pricing. Valve is also able to sell this at around cost and not worry about making money on the hardware itself because they make money through Steam sales, and someone who buys one of these devices is likely going to buy more games on Steam for it. Valve also has their own factory where they build the Index at which gives them advantages in lowering the cost by being able to effectively mass produce the Steam Deck.  The Youtuber Phawx who has a channel dedicated to devices like these posts on MetaCouncil sometimes and he posted this in the Steam Deck thread:    I don't think we're going to be able to see any of the smaller manufactures of similar form factor devices be able to compete with this anytime soon, if ever."

The $400 model would be so much more enticing if you could slap in your own 512GB NVMe for ~$60, and it would make sense for that to be the case too given it is probably cheaper to produce 1 PCB for all Steam Decks and fit each accordingly. The closest competitor to this thing is double the price and nowhere near as powerful. Economy of scale, brand recognition, and making 30% off nearly every game sold on PC in the past 15 years will do that to you. This practically eviscerates any chance that some Kickstarter company can even attempt to enter this space now."

A handheld machine that runs circles around a base PS4 (actually way more faster, considering Zen 2 + RDNA2's architectural gains in perf and efficiency), priced at $399 is just too good, compared what's available in the current ""handheld PC"" space which is circa ~$800-$1400. To add a cherry on top there's the USB-C port where you can connect their own dock or many 3RD party docks with DP 1.4 out to a 144Hz panel and enjoy ""eSports"" titles at HFR, by dropping down presets to lowest and using performance enhancement algorithms like AMD's FSR.

Both were created to serve the same purpose of being a convenient place to launch your individual emulated games and PC titles in one convenient spot.  And yeah, a lot of skins for Launchbox do look like shit, but that's because it started off as a tool for Hyperspin and was built up by a community of people known for making some tacky ass skins. But there's enough good themes, like Colorful.   Playnite desperately needs an in-game overlay/pause menu in order to exit emulators, check Achievements, and other things to, in my opinion, actually put it on par with Launchbox.

shaowebb,2021-07-16 03:00:08,0.9682,No quote,Positive,"This ign breakdown worries me. My biggest concern is based off experience with gpd win consoles that I used to play steam handheld before.  They bring up you van expand your storage with the sdcard slot and even downlaod and play games from the card. However, when you do that this means you are no longer using the full specs of the steamdecj as you would then be throttled by the read write speed of the sdcard reader. On GPD win consoles this meant most high end games had to be ran by installing them to the console itself as they were no longer within system spec to run if you tried to play them from the sdcard. That made the sdcard a low spec storage option mainly for indie and retro gaming.  We need to know what spec games run normally from the sdcard. Finding out my system specs on the card vs on the console was vital on the gpd win and it greatly changes the view consumers should take on considering which version of the steamdeck is viable forntheir gaming habits. Unless theyre cool with deleting aaa games from console and just retaining save data on the cloud or card everytime they want to play another aaa title on this that is.  "
Philippo,2021-07-16 03:01:40,0.9632,quote,Positive,"Serious question that it's way too early to ask: how does this stack against a Series S in terms of holding on with next-gen games?  Early next year I need a new laptop and was eyeing the Asus G14. I want a good laptop to edit and do some work stuff, and if possible to play incoming Xbox exclusives (Fable, Hellblade, Starfield) at 1080p even with DLSS because it's going to be a secondary (or even tertiary). But for the same price of that laptop, I could easily buy one that does the editing and work stuff for much cheaper and use the difference to buy a Steam Deck which is way more comfy to play than a laptop. But I don't know if it will be able to handle those kind of games (of which of course we don't know anything about, so again maybe too early to ask) even at 800p. Any guesses? I am so tempted to cave in on this lol   The fact that we're even able to have this conversation is so hype."

If you really, really want to play the most modern games with all blows and whistles you either have to sacrifice performance or rely on platforms/devices that can run these games like you want.  I don't buy a Switch expecting games to run at 60fps; I don't buy a PS5/Xbox expecting to run Steam's Indie or Early Access titles; I don't buy a PC expecting to play Nintendo's or Sony's first party titles; and I don't buy a portable PC for the money Valve's asking that fits your bag expecting to run every high end game smoothly.  In case of Metro Exodus there's still the non-Enhanced Edition you can go back to without RT."

And th le rear buttons will help keep your thumb on the pad or stick for aiming letting you jump or whatever you want to map them to.

Laver,2021-07-16 03:08:53,0.8373,quote,Positive,"Yes, but directly and fully integrating non-Steam games into the Steam ecosystem would be potentially too damaging for their bottom line. My understanding it that despite the Steam keys ecosystem, which gives the consumer the choice to buy Steam games cheaper elsewhere, >80% of games are still purchased directly via Steam, which shows that most people still choose the easiest and fastest way of adding games to their Steam library.  However, I feel giving competition such an easy access to the Steam userbase would be too dangerous for Valve, eg. you could now potentially play Game Pass games only without ever interacting with the Steam store (though given that MS has not delivered a competent launcher for PC players, it might be too much to expect them to jump on this opportunity lol)."

So far we have seen well-optimized AAA games being showcased by Valve like DOOM Eternal and Death Stranding.   I'd like to see something like Cyberpunk 2077 which gives the AYA NEO and GPD Win 3 a lot of trouble and resolution scaling has to be used to make them playable so they start to look like 3DS games. I think it would be a good benchmark of what kind of power we are looking at here if the Deck is able to run Cyberpunk at 800p at mediumish settings.

Would you expect running through windows to be less performant due to the needs of windows itself?

The big remaining problems are DXR 1.1 (Vulkan RT games like Doom Eternal have worked great for years but DXR is still not finished), anti-cheat and media codecs.  The media code issue is somewhat resolved with Valve re-encoding game videos to VP9 and shipping them to Linux users, but that's a bit of a waste of space and doesn't work with all games yet. Further work on that plus the above issues are what I would guess Valve has progress on internally.  For GPU drivers, Valve doesn't use AMD's. Valve funds the RADV Vulkan driver, an open source component of Mesa. This is generally superior to AMD's Vulkan drivers on both Linux and Windows."

Fadewise,2021-07-16 08:26:54,0.9912,quote,Positive," I was dubious of the stick placement when I first saw it but after looking at it more and comparing to how my thumbs sit on the Switch I think that it actually may be ideal. I've long been a proponent of symmetrical-but-top-position sticks, and keeping the face buttons and dpad lateral to the sticks seems like a more natural movement for the thumb than having to go up or down. The secret sauce here though really is the 4 back buttons; ideally i won't be using the face buttons for much at all since those inputs will largely get mapped to the back buttons.  I'd love nothing more than for Valve to expand Steam's functionality as a true library manager to scrape other game installs and offer more fine grained control over library management with things like editable names/sort names and other user-addressable taxonomies.  It would be nice if this prompts Valve to develop support for Xbox-style download profiles; ie, it knows that you're on a Steam Deck and so can offer alternative depot packages that have lower quality textures or audio files.  The fact that it's only available to order on confirmed Steam accounts that show a purchase before June 2021 for the first 48 hours and requires a $5 deposit should SIGNIFICANTLY kneecap the scalpers ability to suck up a lot of these in that initial pre order window. Frankly, I wish the console manufactures and AIBs would do the same thing at this point."

If a game is ""fixed"" in Proton, it will not be reflected here unless someone reports it. Also, I've played many games that ""just work"" but do not have any reports either way. You also find certain builds of Proton are better for certain games and its easy to change the build used in Steam. In *my* experience so far, 99% the games I've tried have worked, although I don't play online games with anti-cheat etc."

How bad will the load times be for games if I run them off a microsd? I think I'd probably be ok with it if it was comparable to running games off a console hard drive last gen but if it is drastically worse than that I probably won't get one.
Nzyme32,2021-07-16 08:44:36,0.9081,quote,Positive,"Yeah, an evolution of them, so I expect them to be improved. Steam Deck effectively supports the full range of Steam Input options (and more now with added aux grip buttons).  Key difference though is surface area of those pads. It will be interesting to see if the sensitivity suits it. Also in terms of positioning, the resting horizontal axis will be angled differently (steam controller has a slight diagonal offset based on how that controller is held and where your thumbs will be angled)"

I'm not questioning their use, but I have seen a lot of people complaining about the size of the device. The Nintendo Switch uses a vertical button layout and we can all agree it has been a success. The screen itself supports touch but I can imagine other solutions where only a single dedicated touch pad is used, instead of two. In the end it might all be worth it and the majority of the people that get one, prefer the sacrifice of having a larger device, in order to have the touch pads, but that is not yet clear to me."

My only point of reference right now is the Switch and that feels comfortable enough for me. I of course have to get my hands on the Steam Deck in order to have a final opinion on how well the design works for me.
Powerofthecloud,2021-07-16 12:11:35,0.7579,quote,Positive,If it allows adults to actually hold it then I think it's a fair trade-off. The switch is servicable at best for medium to larger hands.
Fadewise,2021-07-16 12:11:40,0.7611,quote,Positive,"So again, you can't fit it in your jeans pocket, but you can't really do that with a full sized Switch either. So if you're carrying it around in a case or backpack anyway what is the actual real-world impact of the additional horizontal space on it's portability?   I'm willing to grant that there are some edge cases where it's a make-or-break, but personally i'd rather have better ergonomics at the expense of some slight diminishment of portability."
collige,2021-07-16 12:14:21,0.3182,quote,Positive, Solution: remap all the face buttons to the back of the controller. That fixes the button issue regardless of which aiming method you're using.

There should be a direct correlation with how big a device is, with how many people are put off by it's portability. But we are getting into a different subject here. I'm not saying that the touch pads will not be a net positive. I'm pointing out how much larger the device got because of them and making the question of how many people would have liked more a design that doesn't have them, in order to get a smaller device."

Fadewise,2021-07-16 12:25:31,0.297,quote,Positive,"yes, obviously an inch less is objectively smaller, but the real-world implication of its impact on portability is debatable. The touchpads objectively made it larger, absolutely, but i would argue that it's a) a good trade off for the expanded control options b) has the side effect of positioning the d-pad and face buttons in a more ergonomic place and c) will not materially affect the actual use case of the device, since nobody was going to pocket it either way."

Multi-user support is definitely one of the weakest points of Steam relative to the consoles.  That would be cool. I'd argue you would need to start back in 2012 or so with the initial Linux client for Steam and its motivations, leading into the development of Vulkan (designed to give a proper alternative to D3D that isn't locked to Microsoft) and then Proton. Pierre-Loup (featured in the IGN videos) is almost certainly a leading player in this, I'd also like to see just how involved Gabe is given his quoted statements and fears about Windows 8 and the growth of the Windows Store."

You could have just had the screen touch sensitive on the sides and have the same functionality without screwing up how most people would use it the majority of the time."

jacktuar,2021-07-16 13:25:17,0.9231,No quote,Positive,"For me the problem with Steam Machines is that they were far too expensive because PC manufacturers want to charge for a premium product. What Valve really needed to do was create a baseline piece of hardware themselves which set expectations for the price point.  That's basically what the Steam Deck is, particularly the $399 model. Its the baseline model that sets the bottom end price expectations. If other PC manufacturers want to charge more, they have to prove the value offered.  And to be honest I absolutely see the Steam Deck as a Steam machine: I'll be using it as one, with the added bonus of being a handheld too. And the price they've set is great."

There's always the option of rendering at a lower resolution if the UI doesn't scale and ends up too small, but that obviously hurts image quality. Most Switch ports that I've seen just display the UI as it is in the PC version of that game, without scaling it up for handheld mode.  I'm still hopeful that there will be one eventually - especially if this is successful. What I'd want is a split controller design like VR controllers or the Joy-Cons. I find those controllers so much more comfortable.  Proton is supposed to take care of that for anything running natively on Steam. They're aiming for 100% compatibility at launch, with the main barrier being anti-cheat tools for multiplayer games not liking Linux or the compatibility layer they run."

None of these issues are show stoppers for me and I accept that it's part of the process when using Proton, but I really think expectations should be tempered in terms of people's Steam libraries working perfectly.  Like for example, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core has a Platinum rating at the moment on ProtonDB, when I know that the intro video doesn't play and the game lingers on a 'connecting to network' screen for a solid minute after an online match. Wouldn't be acceptable for a native commercial product, and I think people might be caught out by this."

Heh, fun fact: Guilty Gear Strive takes about... 3 minutes for ""connecting to server"" when I start up the game. On Windows. I'm not exaggerating. On Linux it takes about 30 seconds, go figure. But yeah, the better Proton gets the less of a reason I have to boot Windows up again, thankfully.  You say this as if I'm not already using Proton every single day. This isn't some new magic tech. Proton has been out and it's open source and has been forked by the community for years now. I know exactly what I'm buying and I already love tinkering around with multiple Linux distros and troubleshooting stuff. I've also been happy with every Valve hardware purchase I've made thus far.

It's nice to have options, heh.  Another (obvious yet) fantastic realization; this thing will be hella nice for playing 4X titles. I really should check if Zeus/Pharaoh work via Lutris, brb...  Edit: Okay, Zeus works with no tweaks if running the vanilla GOG installer. Attempting the widescreen mod install script didn't boot the game whatsoever.

SolarLune,2021-07-16 15:56:19,0.9889,quote,Positive,"First post here; hello!  I picked up the 64gb version and plan to just get a MicroSD card; it should be satsifactory, I reckon.  This is super interesting to me, as I have a ton of games on Steam (as most people), and being able to play them on the go and have an actually powerful compact computer at $400 is kind of insane, haha. I play on Linux normally, so I'm used to normal Proton compatibility, so my expectations are tempered. However, it's interesting to read that Valve is working on improving support for games that have anti-cheat as well, which is kind of the biggest hurdle to the AAA Proton games.  I'm a huge fan of how far Wine and Proton have come in the past few years - at this point, you don't really have to check if major single-player titles run on Proton, because they usually already do. I'm cautiously optimistic about the Steam Deck, and will be eagerly awaiting it.  Installing Windows is definitely an option, but this version of SteamOS does look rather sleek as is, like wow  EDIT: And I'm excited to have a (hopefully!) well-supported, modern, open handheld again. I haven't really had anything like this since the GP2X / Caanoo days, haha."

SolarLune,2021-07-16 16:19:03,0.9866,quote,Positive,"Generally, when Proton (the layer in-between Windows-only Games and Linux) works, it works really well - sometimes it can gives a few extra frames, or run a bit under Windows, but generally be largely identical to playing on Windows. Assuming your computer's install is fine, how often Proton works well is predicated by essentially which games you're trying to run.  Now, to get a good idea of what to expect from some of your favorite games running on the Deck, it might be good to use  to see how games that you're interested in run now - if they show as Platinum, they  run basically flawlessly on the Deck (though each game also has user reports, so you can get an idea of what different users experienced in trying to run the game through it).  That said, I'm guessing Valve might be doing some extra work to resolve some major issues that some Windows games currently have? I can't really imagine them having some extremely high-profile games (mainly multiplayer anti-cheat enabled games) simply not run without any kind of preparations (at least to explain the cause to the user or temper expectations).  Raspberry Pi's not a Wide Boi  (but yes, that would be the more cost effective, non-portable option for a stationary computer, haha)"

The issue, speaking as a desktop user, is having to reboot from my fancy customized Linux OS into the heavily ""meh"" experience of running Windows. I'm only half joking. Also you take up more space on the internal storage just for OS stuff (Windows being much worse than Linux here).

It's a normal PC.  Also I daily Linux specifically for gaming. Out of the 50 or so games in my current rotation, maybe two of them have native Linux versions—the rest being Windows via Proton.

I honestly see most value with this thing in emulation and stuff that would fit well within the 64GB limit (locally streaming everything else). Of course things will expand over time and it's nice to know it won't just turn into a brick when your indies hit 10GB+... provided your battery isn't just dead and irreplaceable at that point.
Skyzar,2021-07-16 18:07:01,0.9801,quote,Positive," It just doesn't make sense to me that it gimps the main way a controller gets used to add something that would get used a lot less when the touchscreen could have been used to do the same thing. It doesn't have to be 1-to-1 mapping with the touchscreen. It could have been something like this, you could even move it about.     Or move it down to where the speaker is. Like just not there. I don't want to claw hold a huge handheld. I want this but not like this.  That dude from IGN said it was comfortable. I don't believe him, but will hope for the best for whoever purchases it. 3 months or so after people get them and enough personal opinions come in, I'll check back. I just don't see how it could be comfortable. It's a claw grip if you're using the triggers."

That's why the device looks the way it does. I suggest unpacking your controller and trying it before dismissing the device."

Pargon,2021-07-16 18:28:58,0.1202,quote,Positive,"The touchpads are pressure-sensitive and mean that you don't have your thumbs covering up a third of the screen. There is a huge number of games which use mouse input that work well on touchpads but not touchscreens. The back buttons and flexibility of Steam Input should mean that you rarely even need the face buttons in many games.  I'm not convinced that the ergonomics are perfect, but the idea of removing the touchpads is ridiculous and comes from a place of not knowing/understanding how they are used. This is an even worse suggestion than people who said the Steam Controller should have used dual analog instead of having touchpads at all. You're completely missing the point if you think that.  I don't even  the face buttons in most games that I play with the Steam Controller."

There is a point of diminishing returns. And the day highly capable APUs became a thing, it was going to alter PC gaming in a significant way. We're finally beginning to reach this point. People who wanna spend 1000+ on a GPU can do their thing. Give me high caliber APUs so I can get the fuck off crazy town. This couldn't come at a better time.

Having all the buttons up sound like a plus, reminds me to the Wii U game pad which was really comfortable to me.  From what I am seeing maybe using the track pads, start and select buttons could cause comfort issues, since they seem to be down, though since the console is kinda big it won´t probably be a problem, but I would have to use it to know for sure."

AAION,2021-07-16 19:06:28,0.9093,quote,Positive,I think he's referring to an option in steam link that basically turns the entire touchscreen into a giant touchpad. It works very well and I hope it is an option as the size and proximity of the current touchpads to the base of the thumb seems very fatiguing for cursor driven games like CRPGs and sims.  The positioning and size of the touchpads and additional analog stick are a retreat from the ideals of the steam controller and valve is clearly positioning this for controller focused games over PC centered games.

The possible voided warranty is also a pain. If we see teardowns that imply to slot is tedious but reasonable to access though, that makes the $400 much more attractive like I previously suggested. I knew there was no way Valve would be printing custom PCBs per SKU."
Pargon,2021-07-16 20:34:32,0.431,quote,Positive,"I’m sure that it will be an option, but my point was that touchscreen doesn’t replace the touchpads at all.  I agree with you that it seems like the touchpads could be out of the primary position for your thumbs now, compared to the Steam Controller. That’s disappointing to me, but I can understand why they’d do it.   I just weighed my Switch, and it’s 415g with the Joy-Cons attached and a glass screen protector applied. 299g is likely the tablet on its own."

Crayon,2021-07-16 21:37:11,0.5647,quote,Positive,"edit: ^^^ oops sorry. Accidental quote.  Gyro aim works best with the touchpads because you can set it to only turn on when you are touching them. Maybe you'd have to try it to understand, but it's more...uh....better.... than the gyro output going every time you move the controller. That way you can let go of the pad to adjust your positon. That's the only use I can think of for touch sensitive sticks. Worth it, tho."
Pargon,2021-07-16 21:40:33,0.0,quote,Neutral,"The most obvious use would be a gyro activator - so that you can reposition the device without moving the camera when you release the stick.  This lets you “reset” the center position without having to think about it, or press a button."

chainlinkspiral,2021-07-16 22:36:58,0.6908,quote,Positive,"Sure. It's going to run just about any modern game fairly well for its specs. You can go into options, like any pc, to customize and get it to work on displays outside its lcd specifications just fine. 4K 60 isn't going to be an option it on very much at all, but devs, indie or otherwise, will be working hard to deliver cool experiences."

Minsc,2021-07-16 23:13:16,0.5549,quote,Positive,"Still never understand these posts too much, even with the Switch, these devices can be charged while in use for no battery loss and indefinite play using super tiny powerbanks - it's not like you're going to be throwing this thing in your pocket, any sort of bag it would go in can also fit a power bank 1/10th the size of this thing.  Also since it's a PC battery life can be customized, if max settings give 3 hours, min settings maybe give 8 (or on a game that gets 8 hours you might be able to stretch it to 12+ if you dim the screen, downclock etc). It's going to be way more flexible than any handheld ever put out before (well non-PC handheld)."

TheMink,2021-07-16 23:20:35,0.9239,quote,Positive,Agreed. I have been what most people call an insane portable user. I brought a 15” Alienware 970m on planes with me and played with a mouse and keyboard Half Life 2 and Metal Gear 5 and It was the stinking best. But the battery is 1hr 45min at best and MGS5 looked like a ps2 game at potato settings. It actually required so much power draw that it literally would not work in a plane outlet and forget battery packs. This thing will run forever and look better and be more versatile if you bring a bag with you with an Anker.
